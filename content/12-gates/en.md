<h2>The Prologue</h2>

<div class='line'>CHilde of this discipline incline to me thine eare</div>
<div class='line'>And harkē to my doctrine with al thy diligēce</div>
<div class='line'>These words of wisedome in minde doe thou beare,</div>
<div class='line'>Which of olde fathers be true in sentence:</div>
<div class='line'>Liue cleane in soule, to God doe no offence.</div>
<div class='line'>Exalt thee not but rather keepe thee lowe,</div>
<div class='line'>Else will thy God in thee no wisdome sowe.</div>

<div class='line'>From sinfull doctrine and wicked thought,</div>
<div class='line'>The holy spirite doth him withdraw,</div>
<div class='line'>Nilling to dwell where sinne is wrought:</div>
<div class='line'>Dread God therefore and obey his law:</div>
<div class='line'>A righteous man forsooke I neuer sawe:</div>
<div class='line'>Neyther his seede begge bread for neede:</div>
<div class='line'>In holy scripture this doe I reede.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Make wisdome therefore thy mother to be,</div>
<div class='line'>And call on Prudence to be thy friend,</div>
<div class='line'>By pathes of truth they will guide thee,</div>
<div class='line'>With loue and honesty wheresoeuer thou wend:</div>
<div class='line'>Both vertuous to be, curteous and hend:</div>
<div class='line'>Pray God therefore that thou maist finde,</div>
<div class='line'>Wisedome and Prudence with mouth and minde.</div>

<div class='line'>All manner good come with them shall,</div>
<div class='line'>And honestie by their hands innumerable,</div>
<div class='line'>Then into cumbrance shalt thou not fall,</div>
<div class='line'>So be they in riches incomparable:</div>
<div class='line'>To worship and profite they will thee able,</div>
<div class='line'>To cunning and all manner of grace,</div>
<div class='line'>Both here and after thy liues space.</div>

<div class='line'>For these benefites which they doe bring,</div>
<div class='line'>I meane these vertues of prudence and sapience,</div>
<div class='line'>To whome I can compare nothing,</div>
<div class='line'>No riches, nor spices of redolence,</div>
<div class='line'>Aboue all treasure such is their excellence,</div>
<div class='line'>That whatsoeuer earthly precious is,</div>
<div class='line'>To them is compared as clay I wis.</div>

<div class='line'>Infinite treasure to man they be,</div>
<div class='line'>Who vseth them shall friendship haue</div>
<div class='line'>With God in heauen and there him see,</div>
<div class='line'>After them therefore busily craue,</div>
<div class='line'>For bodie and soule they will both saue,</div>
<div class='line'>And here in goods thee multiply;</div>
<div class='line'>And afore princes thee dignifie.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Thinke how Adam lost his wisedome,</div>
<div class='line'>Sampson his might which was so strong:</div>
<div class='line'>King Saule also lost his kingdome,</div>
<div class='line'>And Dauid was punished for his wrong:</div>
<div class='line'>In the Oke by the haire fayre Absolon hong,</div>
<div class='line'>King Ezechias by sicknes had punishment,</div>
<div class='line'>And many one moe for sinne was shent.</div>

<div class='line'>But see how other which liued weele,</div>
<div class='line'>And to their God did no offence,</div>
<div class='line'>Such chastisement did neuer feele;</div>
<div class='line'>But God sheweth euer to them beneuolence,</div>
<div class='line'>Enoch and Hely were carried hence,</div>
<div class='line'>To Paradice, and orher good liuers were</div>
<div class='line'>Of God rewarded in diuerse mannere.</div>

<div class='line'>Some had great Fortune, some great cunning,</div>
<div class='line'>Some had great peace, some great riches,</div>
<div class='line'>Some conquered lands to their great wynning▪</div>
<div class='line'>Some were exalted for their great meeknes,</div>
<div class='line'>Some other were saued from the cruelnes</div>
<div class='line'>Of Tyrants, Lyons, and of the hot furnace,</div>
<div class='line'>As Daniel and others in many a place.</div>

<div class='line'>Thus to good liuers God sent great grace,</div>
<div class='line'>And vnto sinners great and sore punishment,</div>
<div class='line'>Some to amend in this life had space,</div>
<div class='line'>Some sodainely with fire from heauen were brent,</div>
<div class='line'>Sinfull Sodomites for euer were shent,</div>
<div class='line'>With Dathan and Abiron with many moe,</div>
<div class='line'>Which sunke for sinne to endles woe.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Thus euer sith this world was wrought,</div>
<div class='line'>God hath rewarded both euill and good:</div>
<div class='line'>Thus if it may rest in thy thought,</div>
<div class='line'>From sinfull liuing to change thy moode.</div>
<div class='line'>If sinfull people this vnderstoode,</div>
<div class='line'>They ought to be afrayde God to offend,</div>
<div class='line'>And soone their sinfull liues to amend.</div>

<div class='line'>Therefore with God looke thou beginne,</div>
<div class='line'>That he by grace may dwell with thee,</div>
<div class='line'>So shalt thou best to wisdome winne;</div>
<div class='line'>And knowledge of our great priuitie:</div>
<div class='line'>Nourish vertues, and from vices flee,</div>
<div class='line'>And trusting thou wilt thee well dispose,</div>
<div class='line'>Our secrets to thee I will disclose.</div>

<div class='line'>Keepe thou them secreate and for me pray,</div>
<div class='line'>Looke that thou vse them to Gods pleasure,</div>
<div class='line'>Doo good with them what euer thou may;</div>
<div class='line'>For time thou shalt this life indure,</div>
<div class='line'>That after thy ende thou mayst be sure</div>
<div class='line'>In heauen for to rewarded be,</div>
<div class='line'>Which God graunt both to me and thee.</div>

<h2>The Preface.</h2>

<div class='line'>O High incomprehensible and glorious Maiestie,</div>
<div class='line'>Whose luminous beames obtundeth our specula∣tion,</div>

<div class='line'>O deuiant from danger, ô drawer most debonayre,</div>
<div class='line'>From this troublesome vale of vanitie, ô our Exalter.</div>

<div class='line'>O power, ô wisdome, ô goodnes inexplicable,</div>
<div class='line'>Supporte me, teach me, and be my gouernor,</div>
<div class='line'>That neuer my liuing to thee be displicable,</div>
<div class='line'>But that I acquite me to thee as true professor,</div>
<div class='line'>At this beginning good Lord heare my prayer,</div>
<div class='line'>Be nigh with grace for to inforce my will,</div>
<div class='line'>Graunt witt that I may mine intent fulfill.</div>

<div class='line'>Most curious Cofer and copious of all treasure,</div>
<div class='line'>Thou art he from whome all goodnes doth discend,</div>
<div class='line'>To man and also to euery creature,</div>
<div class='line'>Thine handy-work therefore vouchsafe to defend,</div>
<div class='line'>That we no time in liuing here mispend,</div>
<div class='line'>With troth here graunt vs our liuing so to winne,</div>
<div class='line'>That into no danger of sinfulnes we rinne.</div>

<div class='line'>And forasumch as we haue for thy sake</div>
<div class='line'>Renounced our wills, the world and fleshly lust,</div>
<div class='line'>As thine owne professors vs to thee take,</div>
<div class='line'>Sith in thee onely dependeth all our trust;</div>
<div class='line'>We can no further; to thee incline we must:</div>
<div class='line'>Thy secret treasure vouchsafe vnto vs,</div>
<div class='line'>Shew vs thy secrets and to vs be bounteous.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And amongst others which be profest to thee,</div>
<div class='line'>I me present as one with humble submission,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy seruant beseeching that I may bee,</div>
<div class='line'>And true in liuing according to my profession,</div>
<div class='line'>In order Chanon Reguler of Bridlington;</div>
<div class='line'>Beseeching thee Lord thou wilt me spare,</div>
<div class='line'>To thy true seruants thy secrets to declare.</div>

<div class='line'>In the beginning when thou mad'st all of nought,</div>
<div class='line'>A globous matter and darke vnder confusion,</div>
<div class='line'>By him the beginning marueilously was wrought,</div>
<div class='line'>Conteyning naturally all things without diuision:</div>
<div class='line'>Of which in six dayes he made cleere distinction:</div>
<div class='line'>As Genesis apertly doth record.</div>
<div class='line'>Then heauen and earth were perfected by his word.</div>

<div class='line'>So through his will and power, out of one mas</div>
<div class='line'>Confused; was made each thing that being is,</div>
<div class='line'>But afore in glory as maker he was,</div>
<div class='line'>Now is and shall be without end I wis,</div>
<div class='line'>And purified soules vp to his blis</div>
<div class='line'>Shall come a principle this may be one,</div>
<div class='line'>For the declaring of our precious stone.</div>

<div class='line'>For as of one masse was made all thing,</div>
<div class='line'>Right so in our practize must it be,</div>
<div class='line'>All our secreats of one Image must spring,</div>
<div class='line'>As in Philosophers bookes whoso list to see,</div>
<div class='line'>Our stone is called the lesse world, one and three;</div>
<div class='line'>Magnesa also of sulphure and Mercurie,</div>
<div class='line'>Proportionate by nature most perfectlie.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But many one marueileth and maruaile may,</div>
<div class='line'>And museth on such a marueilous thing,</div>
<div class='line'>What is our stone; sith Philosophers say</div>
<div class='line'>To such as euer be it in seeking.</div>
<div class='line'>For foules and fisshes to vs doth it bring,</div>
<div class='line'>Euery man it hath, and it is in euery place,</div>
<div class='line'>In thee in me, and in each thing, time and space?</div>

<div class='line'>To this I answere that Mercurie it is I wis,</div>
<div class='line'>But not the common called quicksiluer by name,</div>
<div class='line'>But Mercurie without which nothing being is,</div>
<div class='line'>All Philosophers record and truely saine the same,</div>
<div class='line'>But simple searchers putteth them in blame,</div>
<div class='line'>Saying they hid it but they be blame worthy,</div>
<div class='line'>Which be no Clearkes and meddle with Philosophy.</div>

<div class='line'>But though it Mercurie be, yet wisely vnderstand,</div>
<div class='line'>Wherein it is, and where thou shalt it seech,</div>
<div class='line'>Else I counsell thee take not this work in hand,</div>
<div class='line'>For Philosophers flatter fooles with fayre speech:</div>
<div class='line'>But listen to me, for truly I will thee teach,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is this Mercurie most profitable,</div>
<div class='line'>Being to thee nothing deceiueable.</div>

<div class='line'>It is more neere in some things than in some;</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore take heede what I to thee write</div>
<div class='line'>For if knowledge to thee neuer come,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore yet shalt thou me not twite,</div>
<div class='line'>For I will truely now thee excite</div>
<div class='line'>To vnderstand well Mercuries three,</div>
<div class='line'>The keyes which of this science bee.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Raymond his menstrues doth them call,</div>
<div class='line'>Without which truly no trueth is done:</div>
<div class='line'>But two of them be superficiall,</div>
<div class='line'>The third essentiall of Sunne and Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>Their properties I will declare right soone,</div>
<div class='line'>And Mercurie of mettalls essentiall,</div>
<div class='line'>Is the principle of our stone materiall.</div>

<div class='line'>In Sunne and Moone our Menstrue is not seene,</div>
<div class='line'>It appeareth not but by effect to sight,</div>
<div class='line'>That is the stone of which we meene,</div>
<div class='line'>Who so our writings conceiueth aright,</div>
<div class='line'>It is a soule, a substance bright.</div>
<div class='line'>Of Sunne and Moone a subtill influence,</div>
<div class='line'>Whereby the earth receiueth resplendence.</div>

<div class='line'>For what is Sunne and Moone sayth Auicen,</div>
<div class='line'>But earth which is pure white and red:</div>
<div class='line'>Take from it the said cleerenes, and then</div>
<div class='line'>That earth will stand but in little stead;</div>
<div class='line'>The whole compound is called our lead:</div>
<div class='line'>The qualitie of clearenes from Sun and Moone dooth come,</div>
<div class='line'>These are our menstrues both all and some.</div>

<div class='line'>Bodies with the first we calcine naturally</div>
<div class='line'>Perfect, but none which been vncleene,</div>
<div class='line'>Except one which is vsually</div>
<div class='line'>Named by Philosophers the Lyon greene:</div>
<div class='line'>He is the meane the Sunne and Moone betweene</div>
<div class='line'>Of winning tincture with perfectnes,</div>
<div class='line'>As Geber thereunto beareth witnes.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>With the second which is an humiditie</div>
<div class='line'>Vegitable, reuiuing that earst was dead,</div>
<div class='line'>Both principles materials must loosed be</div>
<div class='line'>And formalls, els stand they little in stead:</div>
<div class='line'>These menstrews therefore know I thee reed,</div>
<div class='line'>Without the which neither true calcination</div>
<div class='line'>Done may be, not true dissolution.</div>

<div class='line'>With the third humiditie most permanent,</div>
<div class='line'>Incombustible and vnctuous in his nature,</div>
<div class='line'>Hermes tree vnto ashes is brent,</div>
<div class='line'>It is our naturall fire most sure,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Mercurie, our Sulphur, our tincture pure,</div>
<div class='line'>Our soule, our stone borne vp with winde</div>
<div class='line'>In the earth ingendred, beare this in minde.</div>

<div class='line'>This stone also tell thee I dare,</div>
<div class='line'>Is the vapour of mettalls potentiall,</div>
<div class='line'>How thou shalt get it, thou must beware,</div>
<div class='line'>For inuisible truely is this menstruall,</div>
<div class='line'>Howbeit with the second water philosophicall,</div>
<div class='line'>By separation of Elements it may appeare</div>
<div class='line'>To sight, in forme of water cleare.</div>

<div class='line'>If this menstrue by labour exuberate</div>
<div class='line'>With it may be made Sulphur of nature,</div>
<div class='line'>If it be well and kindly acuate</div>
<div class='line'>And circulate into a spirit pure,</div>
<div class='line'>Then to dissolue thou must be sure,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy base with it in diuers wise,</div>
<div class='line'>As thou shalt know by thy practise.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>That poynt therefore in his due place,</div>
<div class='line'>I will declare with other moe,</div>
<div class='line'>If God will graunt me grace and space,</div>
<div class='line'>And me preserue in life from woe,</div>
<div class='line'>As I thee teach looke thou doe so:</div>
<div class='line'>And for the first ground principall,</div>
<div class='line'>Vnderstand thy waters menstruall.</div>

<div class='line'>And when thou hast made Calcination,</div>
<div class='line'>Encreasing not wasting moysture radicall,</div>
<div class='line'>Vntill thy base by oft subtilation,</div>
<div class='line'>Will lightly flowe as wax vpon mettall,</div>
<div class='line'>Then loose it with thy vegetable menstruall,</div>
<div class='line'>Till thou haue oyle thereof in colour bright,</div>
<div class='line'>Then is that menstrue visible to sight.</div>

<div class='line'>And oyle is drawne out in colour of golde,</div>
<div class='line'>Or like thereto out of fine red lead,</div>
<div class='line'>Which Raymond sayd when he was olde,</div>
<div class='line'>Much more than golde would stand in stead:</div>
<div class='line'>For when he was for age nigh dead,</div>
<div class='line'>He made thereof Aurum potabile,</div>
<div class='line'>Which him reuiued as men might see.</div>

<div class='line'>For so together may they be circulate,</div>
<div class='line'>That is the base oyle and the vegetable menstruall,</div>
<div class='line'>So that it be by labour exuberate,</div>
<div class='line'>And made by craft a stone celestiall,</div>
<div class='line'>Of nature so firie that we it call,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Bazeliske or our Cockatrice,</div>
<div class='line'>Our great Elixer most of price.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Which as the sight of Bazeliske his obiect</div>
<div class='line'>Killeth, so sleyeth it crude Mercurie,</div>
<div class='line'>When thereupon he is proiect,</div>
<div class='line'>In twinckle of an eye most sodainly,</div>
<div class='line'>That Mercurie then teineth permanently,</div>
<div class='line'>All bodies to Sunne and Moone perfect,</div>
<div class='line'>Thus guide thy base both red and white.</div>

<div class='line'>Aurum potabile thus is made,</div>
<div class='line'>Of golde not commonly calcinate,</div>
<div class='line'>But of our tincture that will not fade,</div>
<div class='line'>Out of our base drawn with the menstrue circulate▪</div>
<div class='line'>But naturall calcination must algate</div>
<div class='line'>Be made, ere thy golde dissolued may bee,</div>
<div class='line'>That principle first therefore I will teach thee.</div>

<div class='line'>But into chapters this Treatise I will diuide,</div>
<div class='line'>In number twelue with due recapitulation;</div>
<div class='line'>Superfluous rehearsalls Ile lay aside,</div>
<div class='line'>Intending onely to giue true information,</div>
<div class='line'>Both of theorick and practick operation:</div>
<div class='line'>That by my writing whoso guided will bee,</div>
<div class='line'>Of his intent perfectly speede shall hee.</div>

<div class='line'>The first chapter shall be of naturall Calcination,</div>
<div class='line'>The second of Dissolution secreat and Philosophicall,</div>
<div class='line'>The third of our elementall Separation,</div>
<div class='line'>The fourth of Coniunction matrimoniall,</div>
<div class='line'>The fift of Putrifaction follow shall,</div>
<div class='line'>Of Congelation albificate shalbe the sixt,</div>
<div class='line'>Then of Cibation the seauenth shall follow next.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>The secret of Sublimation the eight shall show;</div>
<div class='line'>The ninth shall be of firmentation;</div>
<div class='line'>The tenth of our exaltation I trow;</div>
<div class='line'>The eleuenth of our meruailous multiplication;</div>
<div class='line'>The twelfth of proiection, then recapitulation:</div>
<div class='line'>And so this treatize shall take an end,</div>
<div class='line'>By the helpe of God as I intend.</div>

<h2>Of Calcination. The first Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>CAlcination is the purgation of our stone,</div>
<div class='line'>Restoring also of his naturall heate,</div>
<div class='line'>Of radicall humiditie it looseth none,</div>
<div class='line'>Inducing solution into our stone most meete,</div>
<div class='line'>After philosophie I you behight</div>
<div class='line'>Doo, but not after the common guise,</div>
<div class='line'>With Sulphures or Salts preparate in diuers wise.</div>

<div class='line'>Neither with Corosiues nor with fire alone,</div>
<div class='line'>Neither with vineger nor with water ardent,</div>
<div class='line'>Nor with the vapour of leade our stone</div>
<div class='line'>Is calcined according to our intent:</div>
<div class='line'>All those to calcining which so be bent,</div>
<div class='line'>From this hard science withdrawe their hand,</div>
<div class='line'>Till they our calcining better vnderstand.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>For by such calcination their bodies be shent,</div>
<div class='line'>Which minisheth the moysture of our stone:</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore when bodies to powder be brent,</div>
<div class='line'>Dry as ashes of tree or bone,</div>
<div class='line'>Of such calxes then will we none;</div>
<div class='line'>For moysture we multiplie radicall,</div>
<div class='line'>In calcining minishing none at all.</div>

<div class='line'>And for a sure ground of our true calcination,</div>
<div class='line'>Worke wittely only kind with kind:</div>
<div class='line'>For kind vnto kind hath appetitiue inclination,</div>
<div class='line'>Who knoweth not this in knowledge is blind,</div>
<div class='line'>He may foorth wander as mist in the wind,</div>
<div class='line'>Wotting neuer with profite where to light,</div>
<div class='line'>Because he conceaues not our words aright.</div>

<div class='line'>Ioyne kind to kind therefore as reason is,</div>
<div class='line'>For euery burgeon answers his owne seede,</div>
<div class='line'>Man getteth man, a beast a beast I wis,</div>
<div class='line'>Further to treate of this it is no neede.</div>
<div class='line'>But vnderstand this poynt if thou wilt speede,</div>
<div class='line'>Each thing is first calcined in his owne kind;</div>
<div class='line'>This well conceaued fruite therein shalt thou finde.</div>

<div class='line'>And we make Calx vnctuous both white and red</div>
<div class='line'>Of three degrees or our base be perfect,</div>
<div class='line'>Fluxible as waxe, els stand they in no sted.</div>
<div class='line'>By right long processe as Philosophers doo write,</div>
<div class='line'>A yeare we take or more to our respite:</div>
<div class='line'>For in lesse space our Calxes will not be made,</div>
<div class='line'>Able to teyne with colour that will not fade.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And for thy proportion thou must beware,</div>
<div class='line'>For therein maist thou be beguil'd,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore thy work that thou not mare,</div>
<div class='line'>Let thy bodie be subtilly fyl'de</div>
<div class='line'>With Mercury as much then so subtil'd,</div>
<div class='line'>One of the Sunne, two of the Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>Till altogether like papp be doone.</div>

<div class='line'>Then make the Mercurie foure to the Sun▪</div>
<div class='line'>Two to the Moone as it should bee,</div>
<div class='line'>And thus thy worke must be begun,</div>
<div class='line'>In figure of the Trinitee,</div>
<div class='line'>Three of the bodie and of the spirite three,</div>
<div class='line'>And for the vnitie of the substance spirituall</div>
<div class='line'>One moe than of the substance corporall.</div>

<div class='line'>By Raymonds reportory this is true,</div>
<div class='line'>Proportion there who list to looke,</div>
<div class='line'>The same my Doctor to me did shew,</div>
<div class='line'>But three of the spirite Bacon tooke,</div>
<div class='line'>To one of the bodie for which I a wooke,</div>
<div class='line'>Many a night ere I it wist.</div>
<div class='line'>And both be true take which you list.</div>

<div class='line'>If the water also be equall in proportion</div>
<div class='line'>To the earth, with heate in due measure,</div>
<div class='line'>Of them shall spring a new burgeon,</div>
<div class='line'>Both white and red in pure tincture,</div>
<div class='line'>Which in the fire shall euer indure,</div>
<div class='line'>Kill thou the quick the dead reuiue;</div>
<div class='line'>Make trinitie vnitie without any striue.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>This is the surest and best proportion,</div>
<div class='line'>For there is least of the part spirituall,</div>
<div class='line'>The better therefore shall be solution,</div>
<div class='line'>Than if thou did it with water swall,</div>
<div class='line'>Thine earth ouer glutting which loseth all</div>
<div class='line'>Take heede therefore to potters loame,</div>
<div class='line'>And make thou neuer too neshe thy wombe.</div>

<div class='line'>That loame beholde how it tempred is,</div>
<div class='line'>The meane also how it is calcinate,</div>
<div class='line'>And euer in minde looke thou beare this;</div>
<div class='line'>That neuer thine earth with water be suffocate,</div>
<div class='line'>Drye vp thy moysture with heate most temperate,</div>
<div class='line'>Help Dissolution with moysture of the Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>And Congelation with the Sunne, then hast thou doone.</div>

<div class='line'>Foure Natures into the fift so shalt thou turne,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is a Nature most perfect and temperate,</div>
<div class='line'>But hard it is with thy bare foote to spurne</div>
<div class='line'>Against a barr of yron, or steele new acuate,</div>
<div class='line'>For many doe so which be infatuate,</div>
<div class='line'>When they such high things take in hand,</div>
<div class='line'>Which they in no wise doe vnderstand.</div>

<div class='line'>In egges, in vitriall, or in blood,</div>
<div class='line'>What riches wend they there to finde,</div>
<div class='line'>If they Philosophy vnderstood,</div>
<div class='line'>They would not in working be so blinde;</div>
<div class='line'>Golde or siluer to seeke out of kinde:</div>
<div class='line'>For like as fire of burning principle is,</div>
<div class='line'>So is the principle of gilding gould I wis.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>If thou intend therefore for to make</div>
<div class='line'>Gold and Siluer by craft of our philosophie,</div>
<div class='line'>Thereto neyther egges nor bloud thou take</div>
<div class='line'>But Gold and Siluer which naturally</div>
<div class='line'>Calcined wisely and not manually,</div>
<div class='line'>A new generation will forth bring,</div>
<div class='line'>Encreasing their kinde as doth euery thing.</div>

<div class='line'>And if it true were that profit might be</div>
<div class='line'>In things which be not mettaline,</div>
<div class='line'>In which be coulors pleasant to see,</div>
<div class='line'>As in bloud, eggs, haire, vrine. or wine,</div>
<div class='line'>Or in meane mineralls digd out of the myne,</div>
<div class='line'>Yet must that element be putrified and seperate,</div>
<div class='line'>And with Elements of perfect bodies be dispousate.</div>

<div class='line'>But first of these elements make thou rotacion,</div>
<div class='line'>And into water thine earth turne first of all,</div>
<div class='line'>Then of thy water make ayre by leuigacion,</div>
<div class='line'>And ayre make fier, then Maister I will thee call</div>
<div class='line'>Of all our secrets great and small:</div>
<div class='line'>The wheele of Elements then canst thou turne about,</div>
<div class='line'>Truely conceiuing our writings without doubt.</div>

<div class='line'>This done, goe backwards turning the wheele againe,</div>
<div class='line'>And into water turne thy fire anone,</div>
<div class='line'>Ayre into earth, els labourest thou in vaine,</div>
<div class='line'>For so to temperment is brought our stone,</div>
<div class='line'>And Natures contractions foure are made one,</div>
<div class='line'>After they haue three times been circulate,</div>
<div class='line'>And also thy base perfectly consumate.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Thus vnder the moysture of the Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>And vnder the temperate heate of the Sunne,</div>
<div class='line'>Thine Elements shalbe incinerate soone,</div>
<div class='line'>And then thou hast the maistrie wonne:</div>
<div class='line'>Thanke God thy worke was then so begunne,</div>
<div class='line'>For there thou hast one token trewe,</div>
<div class='line'>Which first in blacknes to thee will shewe.</div>

<div class='line'>The head of the Crowe that token call wee,</div>
<div class='line'>And some men call it the Crowes bill;</div>
<div class='line'>Some call it the ashes of Hermes tree,</div>
<div class='line'>And thus they name it after their will:</div>
<div class='line'>Our Toade of the earth which eateth his fill,</div>
<div class='line'>Some nameth it by which it is mortificate</div>
<div class='line'>The spirit with venome intoxicate.</div>

<div class='line'>But it hath names I say to thee infinite,</div>
<div class='line'>For after each thing that blacknes is to sight,</div>
<div class='line'>Named it is till time it waxeth white,</div>
<div class='line'>Then hath it names of more delight,</div>
<div class='line'>After all things that been full white,</div>
<div class='line'>And the red likewise after the same,</div>
<div class='line'>Of all red things doth take the name.</div>

<div class='line'>At the first gate now art thou in,</div>
<div class='line'>Of the Philosophers Castell where they dwell,</div>
<div class='line'>Proceede wisely that thou may winne</div>
<div class='line'>In at moe gates of that Castell,</div>
<div class='line'>Which Castell is round as any bell,</div>
<div class='line'>And gates it hath eleuen yet moe,</div>
<div class='line'>One is conquered, now to the second goe.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the first gate.</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Of Dissolution. The second Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>OF Dissolution now will I speake a word or two,</div>
<div class='line'>Which sheweth out what erst was hid frō sight,</div>
<div class='line'>And maketh intenuate things that were thicke also,</div>
<div class='line'>By vertue of our first menstrue cleare and bright,</div>
<div class='line'>In which our bodies eclipsed been of light,</div>
<div class='line'>And of their hard and drye compaction subtilate,</div>
<div class='line'>Into their owne first matter kindly retrogradate.</div>

<div class='line'>One in gender they be, and in number two,</div>
<div class='line'>Whose Father is the Sunne, the Moone the Mother,</div>
<div class='line'>The Mouer is Mercurie, these and no moe</div>
<div class='line'>Be our Magnesia, our Adropp, and none other</div>
<div class='line'>Things here be, but onely sister and brother,</div>
<div class='line'>That is to meane agent and patient,</div>
<div class='line'>Sulphure and Mercury coessentiall to our intent.</div>

<div class='line'>Betwixt these two equalitie contrarious,</div>
<div class='line'>Ingendred is a meane most marueilously,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is our Mercury and menstrue vnctuous,</div>
<div class='line'>Our secreat Sulphure working inuisibly,</div>
<div class='line'>More fiercely than fire burning the bodie,</div>
<div class='line'>Dissoluing the bodie into water minerall,</div>
<div class='line'>Which night for darknes in the North we doe call.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But yet I trow thou vndestandst not vtterly,</div>
<div class='line'>The very secreat of the Philosophers Dissolution,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore conceiue me I counsell thee wittily,</div>
<div class='line'>For the truth I will tell thee without delusion:</div>
<div class='line'>Our solution is cause of our Congelation;</div>
<div class='line'>For Dissolution on the one side corporall,</div>
<div class='line'>Causeth Congelation on the other side spirituall.</div>

<div class='line'>And we dissolue into water which wetteth no hand,</div>
<div class='line'>For when the earth is integrately incinerate,</div>
<div class='line'>Then is the water congealed; this vnderstand</div>
<div class='line'>For the elements be so together concatenate,</div>
<div class='line'>That when the bodie is from his first forme alterate,</div>
<div class='line'>A new forme is induced immediatly,</div>
<div class='line'>For nothing being without all forme is vtterly.</div>

<div class='line'>And heere a secret to thee I will disclose,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is the ground vnto our secrets all,</div>
<div class='line'>And it not knowne thou shalt but lose</div>
<div class='line'>Thy labour and costs both great and small,</div>
<div class='line'>Take heed therefore in error that thou not fall,</div>
<div class='line'>The more thine earth, and the lesse thy water be,</div>
<div class='line'>The rather and better solucion shalt thou see.</div>

<div class='line'>Behold how yce to water doth relent,</div>
<div class='line'>And so it must for water it was before,</div>
<div class='line'>Right so againe to water our earth is went,</div>
<div class='line'>And water thereby congeald for euermore,</div>
<div class='line'>For after all Philosophers that euer were bore,</div>
<div class='line'>Each mettall was once water mynerall,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore with water they turne to water all.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>In which water of kinde occasionate,</div>
<div class='line'>Of qualities been repugnant and diuersitie,</div>
<div class='line'>Things into things must therefore be rotate,</div>
<div class='line'>Vntill diuersitie be brought to perfect vnitie:</div>
<div class='line'>For Scripture recordeth when the earth shall be</div>
<div class='line'>Troubled, and into the deepe Sea shall be cast,</div>
<div class='line'>Mountaines and bodies likewise at the last.</div>

<div class='line'>Our bodies be likened conueniently</div>
<div class='line'>To mountaines, which after high Planets we name,</div>
<div class='line'>Into the deepnes therefore of Mercurie</div>
<div class='line'>Turne them, and keepe thee out of blame,</div>
<div class='line'>For then shalt thou see a noble game,</div>
<div class='line'>How all shall become powder as soft as silke,</div>
<div class='line'>So doth our rennit kindly kurd vp our milke.</div>

<div class='line'>Then hath the bodies their first forme lost,</div>
<div class='line'>And others been induced immediatly,</div>
<div class='line'>Then hast thou well bestowed thy cost:</div>
<div class='line'>Whereas others vncunning must goe by,</div>
<div class='line'>Not knowing the secrets of our philosohie:</div>
<div class='line'>Yet one poynt more I must tell thee,</div>
<div class='line'>How each bodie hath dimensions three.</div>

<div class='line'>Altitude, Latitude, and also profunditie,</div>
<div class='line'>By which all gates turne we must our wheele,</div>
<div class='line'>Knowing that thine entrance in the West shall be,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy passages forth to the North if thou doo weele,</div>
<div class='line'>And there thy lights lose their lights each deele;</div>
<div class='line'>For there thou must abide by ninetie nights</div>
<div class='line'>In darknes of purgatorie withouten lights.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Then take thy course vp to the East anone,</div>
<div class='line'>By colours passing variable in manifold wise,</div>
<div class='line'>And then be winter and vere nigh ouergone,</div>
<div class='line'>To the East therefore thine ascending deuise,</div>
<div class='line'>For there the Sunne with daylight doth vprise</div>
<div class='line'>In sommer, and there disport thee with delight,</div>
<div class='line'>For there thy worke shall become perfect white.</div>

<div class='line'>Foorth from the East into the South ascend,</div>
<div class='line'>And set thee downe there in the chaire of fire,</div>
<div class='line'>For there is haruest, that is to say an end</div>
<div class='line'>Of all this worke after thine owne desire,</div>
<div class='line'>There shineth the Sunne vp in his Hemisphere,</div>
<div class='line'>After the Eclipses in rednes with glorie,</div>
<div class='line'>As king to raigne vpon all mettals and Mercurie.</div>

<div class='line'>And in one glasse must be done all this thing,</div>
<div class='line'>Like to an Egge in shape and closed weele,</div>
<div class='line'>Then must thou know the measure of firing,</div>
<div class='line'>The which vnknowne thy worke is lost each deele:</div>
<div class='line'>Let neuer thy glasse be hotter than thou maist feele</div>
<div class='line'>And suffer still in thy bare hand to hold,</div>
<div class='line'>For feare of losing, as Philosophers haue told.</div>

<div class='line'>Yet to my doctrine furthermore attend,</div>
<div class='line'>Beware thy glasse thou neuer open ne meue</div>
<div class='line'>From the beginning till thou haue made an end;</div>
<div class='line'>If thou doo contrarie, thy worke may neuer cheue.</div>
<div class='line'>Thus in this Chapter which is but briefe,</div>
<div class='line'>I haue thee taught thy true solution:</div>
<div class='line'>Now to the third gate goe, for this is won.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the second gate.</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Of Seperation. The third gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>SEperation doth each part from other diuide,</div>
<div class='line'>The subtile from the grosse, the thick frō the thinn</div>
<div class='line'>But Seperation manuall looke thou set a side,</div>
<div class='line'>For that pertaines to fooles that little good doth winn,</div>
<div class='line'>But in our Seperation Nature doth not blinn,</div>
<div class='line'>Making diuision of qualities elementall,</div>
<div class='line'>Into a fift degree till they be turned all.</div>

<div class='line'>Earth is turned into water vnder black and bloe,</div>
<div class='line'>And water after into ayre vnder very white,</div>
<div class='line'>Then Aire into fire, elements there be no moe,</div>
<div class='line'>Of these is made our stone of great delight,</div>
<div class='line'>But of this Seperation much more must we write,</div>
<div class='line'>And Seperation is called by Philosophers definition,</div>
<div class='line'>Of the saide foure elements terraptatiue dispersion.</div>

<div class='line'>Of this Seperation I finde a like figure,</div>
<div class='line'>Thus spoken by the Prophet in the Psalmodie,</div>
<div class='line'>God brought out of a stone a flood of water pure,</div>
<div class='line'>And out of the hardest rock oyle abundantly,</div>
<div class='line'>So out of our stone precious if thou be witty,</div>
<div class='line'>Oyle incombustable, and water thou shalt draw,</div>
<div class='line'>And there abouts at the coale thou needst not to blow.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Doe this with heate easie and nourishing,</div>
<div class='line'>First with moyst fire and after that with drie,</div>
<div class='line'>The flegme with patience out drawing,</div>
<div class='line'>And after that the other Natures wittely</div>
<div class='line'>Drye vp thine earth vntill it be thirsty,</div>
<div class='line'>By Calcination else labourest thou in vaine,</div>
<div class='line'>And then make it drink vp the moysture againe.</div>

<div class='line'>Seperation thus must thou oftetimes make,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy waters diuiding into partes two,</div>
<div class='line'>So that the subtile from the grosse thou take,</div>
<div class='line'>Till earth remaine beneath in colours bloe,</div>
<div class='line'>That earth is fixed to abide all woe,</div>
<div class='line'>The other parte is spirituall and flying,</div>
<div class='line'>But thou must turne them all into one thing.</div>

<div class='line'>Then oyle and water with water shall distill,</div>
<div class='line'>And through her helpe receiue mouing,</div>
<div class='line'>Keepe well these two that thou not spill</div>
<div class='line'>Thy worke for lack of due closing,</div>
<div class='line'>And make thy stopple of glasse melting,</div>
<div class='line'>The topp of thy vessell together with it,</div>
<div class='line'>Then Philosopher-like it is vp shit.</div>

<div class='line'>The water wherewith thou mayst reuiue the stone,</div>
<div class='line'>Looke thou distill before thou worke with it,</div>
<div class='line'>Oftentimes by it selfe alone,</div>
<div class='line'>And by this sight thou shalt wit,</div>
<div class='line'>From feculent feces when it is quit:</div>
<div class='line'>For some men can with Saturne it multiplie,</div>
<div class='line'>And other substance which we defie.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Distill it therefore till it be clene</div>
<div class='line'>And thinne like water as it should be,</div>
<div class='line'>As heauen in colour bright and shene,</div>
<div class='line'>Keping both figure and ponderositee,</div>
<div class='line'>Therewith did Hermes moysten his tree:</div>
<div class='line'>Within his glasse he made it grow vpright,</div>
<div class='line'>With flowers discoloured beautifull to sight.</div>

<div class='line'>This water is like to the venymous Tire,</div>
<div class='line'>Wherewith the mighty triacle is wrought,</div>
<div class='line'>For it is poyson most strong of Ire,</div>
<div class='line'>A stronger poyson cannot be thought,</div>
<div class='line'>At Pothecaries often therefore it is sought,</div>
<div class='line'>But no man by it shalbe intoxicate,</div>
<div class='line'>From the time it is into medicine elixerate.</div>

<div class='line'>For then as is the Triacle true,</div>
<div class='line'>It is of poyson most expulsiue,</div>
<div class='line'>And in his working doth marueiles shew,</div>
<div class='line'>Preseruing many from death to life,</div>
<div class='line'>But looke thou meddle it with no corosiue,</div>
<div class='line'>But choose it pure and quick rinning,</div>
<div class='line'>If thou thereby wilt haue winning.</div>

<div class='line'>It is a marueilous thing in kinde,</div>
<div class='line'>And without it can nothing be done,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore Hermes called it his winde,</div>
<div class='line'>For it is vp flying from Sunne and Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>And maketh our stone flie with it soone,</div>
<div class='line'>Reuiuing the dead and giuing life,</div>
<div class='line'>To Sunne and Moone, husband and wife.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Which if they were not by craft made quick,</div>
<div class='line'>And their fatnes with water drawne out,</div>
<div class='line'>And so the thinne disseuered from the thick,</div>
<div class='line'>Thou shouldst neuer bring this worke about:</div>
<div class='line'>If thou wilt therefore speede without doubt,</div>
<div class='line'>Rayse vp the birds out of their neast,</div>
<div class='line'>And after againe bring them to rest.</div>

<div class='line'>Water with water accord will and ascend,</div>
<div class='line'>And spirit with spirit, for they be of one kinde,</div>
<div class='line'>Which after they be exalted make to discend,</div>
<div class='line'>So shalt thou deuide that, which Nature erst did binde,</div>
<div class='line'>Mercury essentiall turning into winde,</div>
<div class='line'>Without which naturall and subtill Seperation,</div>
<div class='line'>May neuer be complete profitable generation.</div>

<div class='line'>Now to helpe thee in at this gate,</div>
<div class='line'>The last secreat I will declare to thee,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy water must be seauen times sublimate,</div>
<div class='line'>Else shall no kindly Dissolution bee,</div>
<div class='line'>Nor putrifying shalt thou none see;</div>
<div class='line'>Like liquid pitch, nor colours appearing</div>
<div class='line'>For lack of fire within the glasse working.</div>

<div class='line'>Foure fires there be which thou must vnderstand,</div>
<div class='line'>Naturall, innaturall, against Nature also,</div>
<div class='line'>And elementall which doth burne the brand:</div>
<div class='line'>These foure fires vse we and no moe,</div>
<div class='line'>Fire against nature must doe thy bodie woe,</div>
<div class='line'>This is our Dragon as I thee tell,</div>
<div class='line'>Fiercely burning as the fire of hell.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Fire of nature is the third menstruall,</div>
<div class='line'>That fire is naturall in each thing;</div>
<div class='line'>But fire occasionate, we call vnnaturall,</div>
<div class='line'>As heate of ashes, and balnes for putrifying:</div>
<div class='line'>Without these fires thou maist naught bring</div>
<div class='line'>To Putrifaction, for to be seperate,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy matters together proportionate.</div>

<div class='line'>Therefore make fire thy glasse within,</div>
<div class='line'>Which burneth the bodie much more than fire</div>
<div class='line'>Elementall, if thou wilt winne</div>
<div class='line'>Our secrets according to thy desire:</div>
<div class='line'>Then shall thy seeds both rot and spire</div>
<div class='line'>By helpe of fire occasionate,</div>
<div class='line'>That kindly after they may be seperate.</div>

<div class='line'>Of Seperation the Gate must thus be wonne,</div>
<div class='line'>That furthermore yet thou maist proceed</div>
<div class='line'>Towards the Gate of secret Coniunction,</div>
<div class='line'>Into the Castle which will thee inner leed:</div>
<div class='line'>Doe after my counsell if thou wilt speed,</div>
<div class='line'>With two strong lockes this Gate is shir,</div>
<div class='line'>As consequently thou shalt well wit.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the third Gate.</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Of Coniunction. The fourth Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>AFter the Chapiter of naturall Seperation,</div>
<div class='line'>By which the elemēts of our stone disseuered be,</div>
<div class='line'>The chapter here followeth of secret Coniunction,</div>
<div class='line'>Which Natures repugnant ioyneth to perfect vnitie,</div>
<div class='line'>And so them knitteth that none from others may flie,</div>
<div class='line'>When they by fire shalbe examinate,</div>
<div class='line'>They be togethers so surely coniungate.</div>

<div class='line'>And therefore Philosophers giue this definition</div>
<div class='line'>Saying this Coniunction is nothing els</div>
<div class='line'>But of disseuered qualities a copulation,</div>
<div class='line'>Or of principles a coequation as others tells:</div>
<div class='line'>But some men with Mercurie that Pothecaries sells</div>
<div class='line'>Medleth bodies, which cannot diuide</div>
<div class='line'>Their matter, and therefore they slip aside.</div>

<div class='line'>For vntill the time the soule be seperate</div>
<div class='line'>And cleansed from his originall sinne</div>
<div class='line'>With the water, and throughly spiritualizate,</div>
<div class='line'>The true Coniunction maist thou neuer begin:</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore the soule first from the bodie twyne,</div>
<div class='line'>Then of the corporall part and of the spirituall.</div>
<div class='line'>The soule shall cause coniunction perpetuall.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Of two Coniunctions Philosophers mencion make,</div>
<div class='line'>Grosse when the bodie with Mercury is reincrudate▪</div>
<div class='line'>But let this passe, and to the second heede take,</div>
<div class='line'>Which as I saide is after Seperation celebrate,</div>
<div class='line'>In which the parties be left with least to colligate,</div>
<div class='line'>And so promoted vnto most perfect temperance,</div>
<div class='line'>That neuer after amongst them may be repugnance.</div>

<div class='line'>Thus causeth Seperation true Coniunction to be had,</div>
<div class='line'>Of water and ayre, with earth and fire,</div>
<div class='line'>But that each element into other may be lad,</div>
<div class='line'>And so abide for euer to thy desire,</div>
<div class='line'>Doe as doe dawbers with clay or myre,</div>
<div class='line'>Temper them thick and make them not too thinne,</div>
<div class='line'>So doe vpdrying, thou shalt the rather winne.</div>

<div class='line'>But manners there be of our Coniunction three,</div>
<div class='line'>The first is called by Philosophers Diptatiue,</div>
<div class='line'>The which betwixt the agent and patient must be,</div>
<div class='line'>Male and female, Mercury, and Sulphure viue,</div>
<div class='line'>Matter, and forme, thinne, and thick to thrine,</div>
<div class='line'>This lesson will helpe thee without any doubt,</div>
<div class='line'>And our Coniunction truly to bring about.</div>

<div class='line'>The second manner is called Triptatiue,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is Coniunction, made of things three,</div>
<div class='line'>Of bodie, soule and spirit, that they not striue,</div>
<div class='line'>Which trinitie thou must bring to vnitee,</div>
<div class='line'>For as the soule to the spirite the bond must bee;</div>
<div class='line'>Right so the bodie the soule to him must knit,</div>
<div class='line'>Out of thy minde let not this lesson flit.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>The third manner and also the last of all,</div>
<div class='line'>Foure Elements together which ioyne to abide,</div>
<div class='line'>Tetraptatiue certainely Philosophers doe it call,</div>
<div class='line'>And specially Guido de Montano whose fame goeth wide,</div>
<div class='line'>And therefore in most laudable maner this tide,</div>
<div class='line'>In our Coniunction foure Elements must aggregate</div>
<div class='line'>In due proportion, which first a sunder were seperate.</div>

<div class='line'>Therefore like as the woman hath veines fifteene,</div>
<div class='line'>And the man but fiue to the act of their secunditie,</div>
<div class='line'>Required in our Coniunction first I meene,</div>
<div class='line'>So must the man our Sunne haue of his water three,</div>
<div class='line'>And nine his wife, which three to him must bee:</div>
<div class='line'>Then like with like will ioy haue for to dwell,</div>
<div class='line'>More of Coniunction me needeth not to tell.</div>

<div class='line'>This chapiter I will conclude right soone therefore,</div>
<div class='line'>Grosse Coniunction charging thee to make but one,</div>
<div class='line'>For seldome haue strumpets children of them ybore,</div>
<div class='line'>And so thou shalt neuer come by our stone,</div>
<div class='line'>Without thou let the woman lig alone,</div>
<div class='line'>That after she once haue conceiued of the man,</div>
<div class='line'>Her Matrix be shut vp from all other than.</div>

<div class='line'>For such as adde euer more crude to crude,</div>
<div class='line'>Opening their vessell letting their matters keele,</div>
<div class='line'>The sparme conceiued they nourish not but delude</div>
<div class='line'>Themselues, and sp•ll their worke each deele,</div>
<div class='line'>If thou therefore haue lift to doe weele,</div>
<div class='line'>Close vp thy Matrix and nourish the seede,</div>
<div class='line'>With heat continual and temperate if thou wilt speed.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And when thy vessell hath stood by moneths fiue,</div>
<div class='line'>And clowdes and Eclipses be passed each one,</div>
<div class='line'>The light appearing, encrease thy heate then beliue,</div>
<div class='line'>Vntill bright and shining in whitenes be thy Stone▪</div>
<div class='line'>Then maist thou open thy glasse anone,</div>
<div class='line'>And feede thy childe which is ybore,</div>
<div class='line'>With milke and meate ay more and more.</div>

<div class='line'>For now both moist and drie is so contemperate,</div>
<div class='line'>That of the water earth hath receiued impression,</div>
<div class='line'>Which neuer (after that) asunder may be seperate;</div>
<div class='line'>And right so water to earth hath giuen ingression,</div>
<div class='line'>That both together to dwell haue made profession,</div>
<div class='line'>And water of earth hath purchased a retentiue,</div>
<div class='line'>They foure made one neuer more to striue.</div>

<div class='line'>Thus in two things all our intent doth hing,</div>
<div class='line'>In drie and moist, which be contraries two▪</div>
<div class='line'>In drie, that it the moyst to flixing bring,</div>
<div class='line'>In moist, that it giue liquefaction to the earth also:</div>
<div class='line'>Then of them thus a temperment may foorth goe,</div>
<div class='line'>A temperment not so thicke as the bodie is,</div>
<div class='line'>Neither so thinne as water withouten mis.</div>

<div class='line'>Loosing and knitting thereof be principles two</div>
<div class='line'>Of this hard science, and poles most principall;</div>
<div class='line'>Howbeit that other principles be many moe,</div>
<div class='line'>As shining fanes, which show I shall:</div>
<div class='line'>Proceede therefore vnto another wall</div>
<div class='line'>Of this strong Castle of our wisdome,</div>
<div class='line'>That in at the fift Gate thou maist come.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the fourth Gate.</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Of Putrifaction. The fift Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>NOw we begin the chapter of Putrifaction,</div>
<div class='line'>Without which pole no seed may multiply,</div>
<div class='line'>Which must be done only by continual action</div>
<div class='line'>Of heate in the bodie, moyst not manually:</div>
<div class='line'>For bodies els may not be altred naturally,</div>
<div class='line'>Sith Christ doth witnes, without the graine of wheate</div>
<div class='line'>Dye in the ground, encrease maist thou none get.</div>

<div class='line'>And in likewise without the matter putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>It may in no wise truly be alterate,</div>
<div class='line'>Neither thy Elements may be diuided kindly,</div>
<div class='line'>Nor the coniunction of them perfectly celebrate:</div>
<div class='line'>That thy labor therefore be not frustrate,</div>
<div class='line'>The priuitie of our putrifying well vnderstand,</div>
<div class='line'>Or euer thou take this worke in hand.</div>

<div class='line'>And Putrifaction may thus defined bee</div>
<div class='line'>After Philosophers sayings, to be of bodies the sleying;</div>
<div class='line'>And in our Compound a diuision of things three,</div>
<div class='line'>The killed bodies into corruption foorth leading,</div>
<div class='line'>And after vnto regeneration them abling,</div>
<div class='line'>For things being in the earth, without doubt</div>
<div class='line'>Be engendred of rotation of the heauens about.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And therefore like as I haue sayd before,</div>
<div class='line'>Thine Elements commixt and wisely coequate,</div>
<div class='line'>Thou keepe in temperate heate eschewing euermore,</div>
<div class='line'>That they by violent heat be not incinerate</div>
<div class='line'>To powder drye vnprofitably Rubificate,</div>
<div class='line'>But into powder black as a crowes bill,</div>
<div class='line'>With heate of Balne or else of our dunghill.</div>

<div class='line'>Vntill the time that nights be passed ninetie,</div>
<div class='line'>In moyst heate keepe them for any thing.</div>
<div class='line'>Soone after by blacknes thou shalt espie</div>
<div class='line'>That they draw fast to putrifying,</div>
<div class='line'>Which thou shalt after many colours bring</div>
<div class='line'>To perfect whitenes by patience easily,</div>
<div class='line'>And so thy seede in his nature shall multiplie.</div>

<div class='line'>Make each the other then to halfe and kisse,</div>
<div class='line'>And like as children to play them vp and downe▪</div>
<div class='line'>And when their shirts are filed with pisse,</div>
<div class='line'>Then let the woman to wash be bowne,</div>
<div class='line'>Which oft for faintnes will fall in a swowne,</div>
<div class='line'>And dye at the last with her children all,</div>
<div class='line'>And goe to purgatorie to purge their filth originall.</div>

<div class='line'>When they be there, by little and little increase</div>
<div class='line'>Their paines, by heat, aye more and more,</div>
<div class='line'>The fire from them let neuer cease.</div>
<div class='line'>And so that thy furnace be surely apt therefore,</div>
<div class='line'>Which wise men call an Athenore,</div>
<div class='line'>Conseruing heat required most temperatelie,</div>
<div class='line'>By which thy matter doth kindly putrifie.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Of this principle speaketh sapient Guido,</div>
<div class='line'>And sayth by rotting dyeth the compound corporall,</div>
<div class='line'>And then after Morien and other moe,</div>
<div class='line'>Vpriseth againe regenerate simple and spirituall,</div>
<div class='line'>And were not heate and moysture continuall,</div>
<div class='line'>Sparme in the wombe might haue none abiding,</div>
<div class='line'>And so there should no fruite thereof vpspring.</div>

<div class='line'>Therefore at the beginning our stone thou take,</div>
<div class='line'>And burie each one in other within their graue,</div>
<div class='line'>Then equally betwixt them a marriage make,</div>
<div class='line'>To ligge together sixe weekes let them haue,</div>
<div class='line'>Their seede conceiued, kindly to nourish and saue,</div>
<div class='line'>From the ground of their graue not rising that while,</div>
<div class='line'>Which secreat point doth many a one beguile.</div>

<div class='line'>This time of conception with easie heate abide,</div>
<div class='line'>The blacknes shewing shall tell thee when they dye,</div>
<div class='line'>For they togeather like liquid pitch that tide,</div>
<div class='line'>Shall swell and burble, settle and putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>Shining colours therin thou shalt espie,</div>
<div class='line'>Like to the rainebow marueilous to sight,</div>
<div class='line'>The Water then beginneth to drye vpright.</div>

<div class='line'>For in moyst bodies heate working temperate,</div>
<div class='line'>Ingendreth blacknes, first of all which is,</div>
<div class='line'>Of kindly Coniunction the token assignate,</div>
<div class='line'>And of true putrifying: remember this,</div>
<div class='line'>For then perfectly to alter thou canst not misse,</div>
<div class='line'>And thus by the gate of blacknes thou must come in,</div>
<div class='line'>The light of Paradice in whitenes if thou wilt win.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>For first the Sunne in his vprising obscurate</div>
<div class='line'>Shalbe, and passe the waters of Noes flood,</div>
<div class='line'>On earth which was an hundreth dayes continuate</div>
<div class='line'>And fiftie, away ere all these waters yood;</div>
<div class='line'>Right so our waters (as wisemen vnderstood)</div>
<div class='line'>Shall passe, that thou with Dauid may say,</div>
<div class='line'>Abierunt in sicco flumina: beare this away.</div>

<div class='line'>Soone after that Noah planted his vineyard,</div>
<div class='line'>Which royally flourished, and brought foorth grapes anone,</div>
<div class='line'>After which space thou shalt not be afeard,</div>
<div class='line'>For in likewise shal follow the flourishing of our stone:</div>
<div class='line'>And soone after that xxx. dayes be gone,</div>
<div class='line'>Thou shalt haue grapes right as Rubie read,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is our Adropp, our Vcifer, and our red lead.</div>

<div class='line'>For like as soules after paines transitorie</div>
<div class='line'>Be brought to Paradice, where euer is ioyfull life;</div>
<div class='line'>So shall our Stone (after his darknes in Purgatorie)</div>
<div class='line'>Be purged, and ioyned in Elements withouten strife,</div>
<div class='line'>Reioyce the whitenes and beautie of his wife,</div>
<div class='line'>And passe from darknes of purgatorie to light</div>
<div class='line'>Of Paradice, in whitenes Elixer of great might.</div>

<div class='line'>And that thou maist the rather to Putrifaction win,</div>
<div class='line'>This example thou take to thee for a true conclusion,</div>
<div class='line'>For all the secret of Putrifaction resteth therein;</div>
<div class='line'>The hart of oke that hath of water continuall infusion</div>
<div class='line'>Will not soone putrifie, I tell thee without delusion:</div>
<div class='line'>For though it in water lay 100. yeares and more.</div>
<div class='line'>Yet shouldst thou finde it sound as ere it was before.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But and thou keepe it sometime wet & sometime drie,</div>
<div class='line'>As thou maist see in timber by vsuall experiment,</div>
<div class='line'>By processe of time that oke shall putrifie;</div>
<div class='line'>And so euen likewise according to our intent,</div>
<div class='line'>Sometime our tree must with the Sunne be brent,</div>
<div class='line'>And then with water we must it keele,</div>
<div class='line'>That by this meanes to rotting we may bring it weele.</div>

<div class='line'>For now in wet, and now againe in drie,</div>
<div class='line'>And now in heate, and now againe in colde</div>
<div class='line'>To be, shall cause it soone to putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>And so shalt thou bring to rotting thy golde:</div>
<div class='line'>Intreate thy bodies as I haue thee tolde,</div>
<div class='line'>And in thy putrifying, with heate be not too swift,</div>
<div class='line'>Least in the ashes thou seeke after thy thrift.</div>

<div class='line'>Therefore thy water out of the earth thou drawe,</div>
<div class='line'>And make the soule therewith for to ascend;</div>
<div class='line'>Then downe againe into the earth it throwe,</div>
<div class='line'>That they oft times so ascend and descend:</div>
<div class='line'>From violent heate and sudden colde defend</div>
<div class='line'>Thy glasse, and make thy fire so temperate,</div>
<div class='line'>That by the sides the matter be not vitrificate.</div>

<div class='line'>And be thou wise in choosing of the matter,</div>
<div class='line'>Meddle with no salts, sulphurs, nor meane mineralls:</div>
<div class='line'>For whatsoeuer any worker to thee doth clatter,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Sulphur and our Mercury been onely in metttalls,</div>
<div class='line'>Which oyles and waters some men them calls,</div>
<div class='line'>Foules and birds, with other names many one,</div>
<div class='line'>Because that fooles should neuer know our stone.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>For of this world our stone is called the sement</div>
<div class='line'>Which moued by craft as nature doth require,</div>
<div class='line'>In his encrease shall be full opulent,</div>
<div class='line'>And multiply his kinde after thine owne desire,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore if God vouchsafe thee to inspire,</div>
<div class='line'>To know the truth, and fansies to eschew</div>
<div class='line'>Like vnto thee in riches shall be but few.</div>

<div class='line'>But many men be moou'd to worke after their fantasie,</div>
<div class='line'>In many subiects in which be tinctures gay:</div>
<div class='line'>Both white and red diuided manually</div>
<div class='line'>To sight, but in the fire they flyeaway:</div>
<div class='line'>Such breake pottes and glasses day by day,</div>
<div class='line'>Enpoysoning themselues and loosing their sights,</div>
<div class='line'>With odours, smoakes, and watching vp by nights.</div>

<div class='line'>Their clothes be baudy and worne thread bare,</div>
<div class='line'>Men may them smell for multipliers where they goe,</div>
<div class='line'>To file their fingers with corosiues they doo not spare,</div>
<div class='line'>Their eyes be bleard, their cheekes leane and blowe,</div>
<div class='line'>And thus for had I wist they suffer losse and woe:</div>
<div class='line'>And such when they haue lost that was in their purse,</div>
<div class='line'>Then doo they chide, and Philosophers sore doo curse.</div>

<div class='line'>To see their houses it is a noble sport,</div>
<div class='line'>What furnaces, what glasses there be of diuers shapes,</div>
<div class='line'>What salts, what powders, what oyles, waters fort,</div>
<div class='line'>How eloquently de Materia prima their tungs do clap,</div>
<div class='line'>And yet to finde the truthe they haue no hap;</div>
<div class='line'>Of our Mercurie they meddle & of our sulphure viue,</div>
<div class='line'>Wherein they dote, and more and more vnthriue.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>For all the while they haue Philosophers bene,</div>
<div class='line'>Yet could they neuer know what was our Stone,</div>
<div class='line'>Some sought it in dung, in vrine, some in wine,</div>
<div class='line'>Some in starre slyme (for thing it is but one),</div>
<div class='line'>In blood, in egges: some till their thrift was gone,</div>
<div class='line'>Diuiding Elements, and breaking manie a pot,</div>
<div class='line'>Sheards multiplying, but yet they hit it not.</div>

<div class='line'>They talke of the red man and of his white wife,</div>
<div class='line'>That is a speciall thing, and of the Elixers two,</div>
<div class='line'>Of the Quintessence, and of the Elixer of life,</div>
<div class='line'>Of honie, Celidonie, and of Secondines also,</div>
<div class='line'>These they diuide into Elements, with others moe;</div>
<div class='line'>No multipliers, but Philosophers called will they bee,</div>
<div class='line'>Which naturall Philosophie did neuer read nor see.</div>

<div class='line'>This fellowship knoweth our Stone right weele,</div>
<div class='line'>They thinke them richer than is the King,</div>
<div class='line'>They will him help, he shall not faile</div>
<div class='line'>Fraunce for to winne a wondrous thing,</div>
<div class='line'>The holy Crosse home will they bring,</div>
<div class='line'>And if the King were prisoner ytake,</div>
<div class='line'>Right soone his raunsome would they make.</div>

<div class='line'>A meruaile it is that Westminster Kerke,</div>
<div class='line'>To the which these Philosophers doo much haunt,</div>
<div class='line'>Since they can so much riches werke</div>
<div class='line'>As they make boast of and auaunt,</div>
<div class='line'>Drinking daylie at the wine a due taunt,</div>
<div class='line'>Is not made vp perfectly at once;</div>
<div class='line'>For truly it lacketh yet many stones.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Fooles doo follow them at the taile,</div>
<div class='line'>Promoted to riches weening to bee;</div>
<div class='line'>But will you heare, what worship and auaile</div>
<div class='line'>They winne in London that noble Citie?</div>
<div class='line'>With siluer maces (as you may see)</div>
<div class='line'>Sergeants awaiteth on them each bowre,</div>
<div class='line'>So been they men of great honour.</div>

<div class='line'>Sergeants seeke them from streete to streete,</div>
<div class='line'>Merchants and Goldsmiths lay after them watch,</div>
<div class='line'>That well is him that with them may meete,</div>
<div class='line'>For the great aduantage that they doe catch,</div>
<div class='line'>They hunt about as doth a bratch,</div>
<div class='line'>Weening to winne so great treasure,</div>
<div class='line'>That euer in riches they shall endure.</div>

<div class='line'>Some would catch their goods againe,</div>
<div class='line'>And some more good would aduenture,</div>
<div class='line'>Some for to haue would be full faine</div>
<div class='line'>Of ten pounds one, I you ensure,</div>
<div class='line'>Some which haue lent without measure</div>
<div class='line'>Their goods, and be with pouertie clad,</div>
<div class='line'>To catch a noble, would be full glad.</div>

<div class='line'>But when the Sergeants doth them arrest,</div>
<div class='line'>Their pautners be stuffed with Paris balls,</div>
<div class='line'>Or with signets of Saint Martins at the least;</div>
<div class='line'>But as for money it is pist against the walls:</div>
<div class='line'>Then be they led (as well for them befalls)</div>
<div class='line'>To Newgate or Ludgate as I you tell,</div>
<div class='line'>Because they shall in safegard dwell.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Where is my money become, saith one?</div>
<div class='line'>And where is mine, saith he and he?</div>
<div class='line'>But will you heare how subtill they be anone</div>
<div class='line'>In answering, that they excused be?</div>
<div class='line'>Saying, of our Elixers robbed be we,</div>
<div class='line'>Else might we haue paid you all your golde,</div>
<div class='line'>Though it had been more by tenne folde.</div>

<div class='line'>And then their Creditors they flatter so,</div>
<div class='line'>Promising to worke for them againe</div>
<div class='line'>In right short space the Elixers two,</div>
<div class='line'>Doting the Merchants that they be faine</div>
<div class='line'>To let them goe, but euer in vaine;</div>
<div class='line'>They worke so long, till at the last,</div>
<div class='line'>They be againe in prison cast.</div>

<div class='line'>If any them aske, why they be not ritch?</div>
<div class='line'>They say they can make fine golde of tinne,</div>
<div class='line'>But he (say they) may surely swimme the ditch,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is vpholden by the chinne;</div>
<div class='line'>We haue no stock, therefore may we not winne,</div>
<div class='line'>Which if we had, we would soone werck</div>
<div class='line'>Inough to finish vp Westminster Kerck.</div>

<div class='line'>And some of them be so deuout,</div>
<div class='line'>They will not dwell out of that place;</div>
<div class='line'>For there they may withouten doubt</div>
<div class='line'>Doe what them list to their solace,</div>
<div class='line'>The Archdeacon is so full of grace,</div>
<div class='line'>That if they blesse him with their crosse,</div>
<div class='line'>He forceth little of other mens losse.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And when they there sit at the wine,</div>
<div class='line'>These Monkes they say haue manie a pound,</div>
<div class='line'>Would God (saith one) that some were mine.</div>
<div class='line'>Yet care away, let the cup goe round;</div>
<div class='line'>Drinke on saith another, the meane is found,</div>
<div class='line'>I am a maister of that Arte,</div>
<div class='line'>I warrant vs we shall haue part.</div>

<div class='line'>Such causeth Monkes euill to doone,</div>
<div class='line'>To waste their wages through their dotage,</div>
<div class='line'>Some bringeth a mazer, and some a spoone,</div>
<div class='line'>Their Philosophers giueth them such comage,</div>
<div class='line'>Behighting them winning with domage,</div>
<div class='line'>A pound for a penie at the least againe;</div>
<div class='line'>And so faire promises make fooles faine.</div>

<div class='line'>A royall medicine one vpon twelue,</div>
<div class='line'>They promise them thereof to haue,</div>
<div class='line'>Which they could neuer for them-selue</div>
<div class='line'>Yet bring about, so God me saue:</div>
<div class='line'>Beware such Philosophers no man depraue,</div>
<div class='line'>Which helpe these Monkes to riches so,</div>
<div class='line'>In thread bare coates that they must goe.</div>

<div class='line'>The Abbot ought well to cherish this companie,</div>
<div class='line'>For they can teach his Monkes to liue in pouertie,</div>
<div class='line'>And to goe cloathed and moneyed religiouslie,</div>
<div class='line'>As did Saint Bennet, eschuing superfluitie,</div>
<div class='line'>Easing them also of the ponderositie</div>
<div class='line'>Of their purses, with pounds so aggrauate,</div>
<div class='line'>Which by Philosophie be now alleuiate.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Lo who so medleth with this rich companie,</div>
<div class='line'>Great boast of their winning they may make:</div>
<div class='line'>For they shall reape as much by their Philosophie,</div>
<div class='line'>As they of the taile of an ape, can take:</div>
<div class='line'>Beware therefore for Iesus sake,</div>
<div class='line'>And meddle with nothing of great cost,</div>
<div class='line'>For if thou doe, it is but lost.</div>

<div class='line'>These Philosophers (of which I spake before)</div>
<div class='line'>Meddle and blunder with manie a thing,</div>
<div class='line'>Running in errours euer more and more,</div>
<div class='line'>For lacke of true vnderstanding:</div>
<div class='line'>But like must like alwaies forth bring,</div>
<div class='line'>So hath God ordained in euerie kinde;</div>
<div class='line'>Would Iesus they would beare this in minde.</div>

<div class='line'>Weene they of a Nettle to haue a Rose,</div>
<div class='line'>Or of an Elder to haue an apple sweete:</div>
<div class='line'>Alas, that wisemen their goods should lose,</div>
<div class='line'>Trusting such lorrells when they them meete,</div>
<div class='line'>Which say our Stone is troden vnder feete,</div>
<div class='line'>And maketh them vile things to distill,</div>
<div class='line'>Till all their howses with stench they fill.</div>

<div class='line'>Some of them neuer learned a word in Schooles,</div>
<div class='line'>Should such by reason vnderstand Philosophie?</div>
<div class='line'>Be they Philosophers? Nay, they be fooles:</div>
<div class='line'>For their workes proue them vnwittie,</div>
<div class='line'>Meddle not with them, if thou be happie;</div>
<div class='line'>Least with their flatterie they so thee till,</div>
<div class='line'>That thou agree vnto their will.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Spend not thy money away in waste,</div>
<div class='line'>Giue not to euery spirit credence,</div>
<div class='line'>But first examine, groape, and taste;</div>
<div class='line'>And as thou proouest, so put thy confidence,</div>
<div class='line'>But euer beware of great expence:</div>
<div class='line'>And if the Philosopher doe liue vertuouslie,</div>
<div class='line'>The better thou maist trust his Philosophie.</div>

<div class='line'>Prooue him first, and him appose</div>
<div class='line'>Of all the secrets of our Stone;</div>
<div class='line'>Which if he knowe not, thou need not to lose,</div>
<div class='line'>Meddle thou no further, but let him gone,</div>
<div class='line'>Make he neuer so piteous a mone;</div>
<div class='line'>For then the Fox can fagge and faine,</div>
<div class='line'>When he would to his pray attaine.</div>

<div class='line'>If he can answere as a Clarke,</div>
<div class='line'>Howbeit he hath not prooued it indeed,</div>
<div class='line'>And thou then help him to his warke;</div>
<div class='line'>If he be vertuous I hold it meed,</div>
<div class='line'>For he will thee quite if euer he speed,</div>
<div class='line'>And thou shalt knowe by a little anone,</div>
<div class='line'>If he haue knowledge of our Stone.</div>

<div class='line'>One thing, one glasse, one furnace, and no moe,</div>
<div class='line'>Behold this principle if he doe take,</div>
<div class='line'>And if he doe not, then let him goe,</div>
<div class='line'>For he shall neuer thee rich man make;</div>
<div class='line'>Timely it is better thou him forsake,</div>
<div class='line'>Than after with losse and variance,</div>
<div class='line'>And other manner of displeasance.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But if God fortune thee to haue</div>
<div class='line'>This Science by doctrine which I haue told,</div>
<div class='line'>Discouer it not whosoeuer it craue,</div>
<div class='line'>For fauour, feare, siluer, or gold;</div>
<div class='line'>Be no oppressor, letcher nor boaster bold:</div>
<div class='line'>Serue thy God, and help the poore among,</div>
<div class='line'>If thou this life lift to continue long.</div>

<div class='line'>Vnto thy selfe thy secrets euer keepe</div>
<div class='line'>From sinners, which haue not God in dread,</div>
<div class='line'>But will thee cast in prison deepe,</div>
<div class='line'>Till thou them teach to doe it indeed,</div>
<div class='line'>Then slaunder on thee shall spring and spread,</div>
<div class='line'>That thou doest coyne then will they say,</div>
<div class='line'>And so vndoe thee for euer and aye.</div>

<div class='line'>And if thou teach them this cunning,</div>
<div class='line'>Their sinfull liuing for to maintaine,</div>
<div class='line'>In hell therefore shalbe thy woonning,</div>
<div class='line'>For God of thee and them will take disdaine:</div>
<div class='line'>As thou nought couldst therefore thee faine,</div>
<div class='line'>That bodie and soule thou maist both saue,</div>
<div class='line'>And here in peace thy liuing to haue.</div>

<div class='line'>Now in this Chapter I haue thee taught,</div>
<div class='line'>How thou thy bodies must putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>And so to guide thee that thou be not caught,</div>
<div class='line'>And put to durance losse or villanie</div>
<div class='line'>My doctrine therefore remember wittely,</div>
<div class='line'>And passe forth towards the sixt Gate,</div>
<div class='line'>For thus the fift is triumphate.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the fift Gate.</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Of Congelation. The sixt Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>OF Congelation I need not much to write:</div>
<div class='line'>But what it is, I will to thee declare;</div>
<div class='line'>It is of soft things induration of colour white,</div>
<div class='line'>And confixation of spirits which flying are;</div>
<div class='line'>How to congeale, he needeth not much to care,</div>
<div class='line'>For Elements will knit together soone,</div>
<div class='line'>So that Putrifaction be kindly doone.</div>

<div class='line'>But Congelations be made in diuers wise,</div>
<div class='line'>Of spirits and bodies dissolued to water cleare,</div>
<div class='line'>Of salts also dissolued twice or thrise,</div>
<div class='line'>And then congeald into a fluxible matter;</div>
<div class='line'>Of such congealing, fooles fast doo clatter,</div>
<div class='line'>And some dissolueth diuiding manuallie</div>
<div class='line'>Elements them after congealing to powder drie.</div>

<div class='line'>But such congealing is not to our desire,</div>
<div class='line'>For vnto ours it is contrarious,</div>
<div class='line'>Our congelation dreadeth not the fire:</div>
<div class='line'>For it must euer stand in it vnctuous,</div>
<div class='line'>And it is also a tincture so bounteous,</div>
<div class='line'>Which in the aire congealed will not relent</div>
<div class='line'>To water, for then our worke were shent.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Moreouer congeale not into so hard a stone</div>
<div class='line'>As glasse or christall, which melteth by fusion,</div>
<div class='line'>But so that it like waxe will melt anone</div>
<div class='line'>Withouten blast: and beware of delusion,</div>
<div class='line'>For such congealing accordeth not to our conclusion</div>
<div class='line'>As will not flowe, but runne to water againe</div>
<div class='line'>Like salt congealed, then labourest thou in vaine.</div>

<div class='line'>Which congelation auaileth vs not a deale,</div>
<div class='line'>It longeth to multipliers, congealing vulgarly:</div>
<div class='line'>If thou therefore list to doe weele</div>
<div class='line'>(Sith the medicine shall neuer flowe kindly,</div>
<div class='line'>Neither congeale, without thou first it putrifie)</div>
<div class='line'>First purge, and then fixe the elements of our stone,</div>
<div class='line'>Till they together congeale and flowe anone.</div>

<div class='line'>For when thy matter is made perfectly white,</div>
<div class='line'>Then will the spirit with the bodie congealed be:</div>
<div class='line'>But of that time thou maist haue long respite</div>
<div class='line'>Or it congeale like pearles in sight to thee,</div>
<div class='line'>Such congel••••n be thou glad to see,</div>
<div class='line'>And after lik• graines red as blood,</div>
<div class='line'>Richer than any worldly good.</div>

<div class='line'>The earthly grosenes therefore first mortified,</div>
<div class='line'>In moysture blacknes ingendred is;</div>
<div class='line'>This principle may not be denied,</div>
<div class='line'>For naturall Philosophers so sayne ywis:</div>
<div class='line'>Which had, of whitenes thou maist not mis;</div>
<div class='line'>And into whitenes if thou congeale it once,</div>
<div class='line'>Then hast thou a stone most precious of all stones.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And by the drie like as the moist did putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>Which caused in colour blacknes to appeare,</div>
<div class='line'>Right so the moyst congealed by the drie,</div>
<div class='line'>Ingendreth whitenes shining by night full cleare,</div>
<div class='line'>And drines proceedeth as whiteth the matter,</div>
<div class='line'>Like as in blacknes moysture doth him shew</div>
<div class='line'>By colours variant alwayes new and new.</div>

<div class='line'>The cause of all this is heate most temperate,</div>
<div class='line'>Working and mouing the matter continually,</div>
<div class='line'>And thereby also the matter is alterate,</div>
<div class='line'>Both inward and outward substantially,</div>
<div class='line'>Not as doo fooles to sight sophistically:</div>
<div class='line'>But in euerie part all fire to endure,</div>
<div class='line'>Fluxible, fixt, and stable in tincture.</div>

<div class='line'>As Phisicke determineth of each digestion,</div>
<div class='line'>First done in the stomach in which is drines,</div>
<div class='line'>Causing whitenes without question,</div>
<div class='line'>Like as the second digestion causeth rednes,</div>
<div class='line'>Complete in the liuer by heate in temperatenes,</div>
<div class='line'>Right so our Stone by drines and by heate</div>
<div class='line'>Digested is to white and red compleate.</div>

<div class='line'>But here thou must another secret knowe,</div>
<div class='line'>How the Philosophers childe in the ayre is borne,</div>
<div class='line'>Busie thee not too fast at the coale to blowe,</div>
<div class='line'>And take this neither for mocke nor scorne,</div>
<div class='line'>But trust me truly, else is all thy worke forlorne,</div>
<div class='line'>Without thine earth with water reuiued bee,</div>
<div class='line'>Our true congealing shalt thou neuer see.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>A soule it is betwixt heauen and earth being,</div>
<div class='line'>Arising from the earth as ayre with water pure,</div>
<div class='line'>And causing life in euerie liuely thing,</div>
<div class='line'>Incessable running vpon our foure folde nature,</div>
<div class='line'>Enforcing to better him with all his cure,</div>
<div class='line'>Which ayre is the fire of our Philosophie,</div>
<div class='line'>Named now oyle, now water mysticallie.</div>

<div class='line'>And this meane ayre which oyle or water we call,</div>
<div class='line'>Our fire, our oyntment, our spirit, and our Stone,</div>
<div class='line'>In which one thing we ground our wisedomes all,</div>
<div class='line'>Goeth neither in nor out alone,</div>
<div class='line'>Nor the fire but the water anone:</div>
<div class='line'>First it out leadeth, and after it bringeth it in,</div>
<div class='line'>As water with water which will not lightly twin.</div>

<div class='line'>And so may water only our water meeue,</div>
<div class='line'>Which mouing causeth both death and life</div>
<div class='line'>And water to water doth kindly cleeue</div>
<div class='line'>Without repugnance or anie strife,</div>
<div class='line'>Which water to fooles is nothing rife,</div>
<div class='line'>Being of the kinde withouten doubt</div>
<div class='line'>Of the spirit, called water and leader out.</div>

<div class='line'>And water is the secret and life of euery thing,</div>
<div class='line'>That is of substance in this world yfound,</div>
<div class='line'>For of water each thing hath his beginning,</div>
<div class='line'>As showeth in women when they shalbe vnbound</div>
<div class='line'>By water, which passeth before if all be sound,</div>
<div class='line'>Called Albien, first from them running,</div>
<div class='line'>With greeuous throwes before their childing.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And truly that is the cause most principall</div>
<div class='line'>Why Philosophers charge vs to be patient,</div>
<div class='line'>Till time the water be dried to powder all</div>
<div class='line'>With nourishing heate, continuall, not violent:</div>
<div class='line'>For qualities be contrarious of euerie element,</div>
<div class='line'>Till after blacke in white be made an vnion</div>
<div class='line'>Of them for euer, congeald without diuision.</div>

<div class='line'>And furthermore, the preparation of this conuersion:</div>
<div class='line'>From thing to thing, from one state to another,</div>
<div class='line'>Is done onely by kindly and discreete operation</div>
<div class='line'>Of Nature, as is of sperme within the mother;</div>
<div class='line'>For sperme and heate, are as sister and brother,</div>
<div class='line'>Which be conuerted in themselues as nature can,</div>
<div class='line'>By action and passion at last to perfect man:</div>

<div class='line'>For as the bodily part by nature was combyn•te</div>
<div class='line'>Into man, is such as the beginner was▪</div>
<div class='line'>Which though it thus frō thing to thing was alterate</div>
<div class='line'>Not out of kinde, to mixe with other kinde did passe,</div>
<div class='line'>And so our matter spermaticall within our glasse,</div>
<div class='line'>Within it selfe must turne from thing to thing▪</div>
<div class='line'>By heate most temperate only it nourishing.</div>

<div class='line'>An other example naturall I may thee tell,</div>
<div class='line'>How the substance of an egge by nature is wrought</div>
<div class='line'>Into a Chicken not passing out of the shell,</div>
<div class='line'>A plainer example could I not haue thought,</div>
<div class='line'>And their conuersions be made till forth be brought</div>
<div class='line'>From state to state, the like by like in kinde,</div>
<div class='line'>With nourishing heate: onely beare this in minde.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Another example here also thou maist read</div>
<div class='line'>Of vegetable things, taking consideration,</div>
<div class='line'>How euerie thing groweth of his owne seede</div>
<div class='line'>Through heate and moysture, by naturall operation;</div>
<div class='line'>And therfore myneralls be nourished by ministration</div>
<div class='line'>Of moysture radicall, which there beginning was,</div>
<div class='line'>Not passing their kinde within one glas.</div>

<div class='line'>There we them turne from thing to thing againe,</div>
<div class='line'>Into their mother the water when they goe:</div>
<div class='line'>Which principle vnknowen, thou labourest in vaine.</div>
<div class='line'>Then all is sperme; and things there be no moe</div>
<div class='line'>But kinde with kinde in number two,</div>
<div class='line'>Male and female, agent and patient,</div>
<div class='line'>Within the matrix of the earth most orient.</div>

<div class='line'>And these be turned by heate from thing to thing</div>
<div class='line'>Within one glasse, and so from state to state,</div>
<div class='line'>Vntill the time that nature doth them bring</div>
<div class='line'>Into one substance of the water regenerate:</div>
<div class='line'>And so the sperme with his kinde is alterate,</div>
<div class='line'>Able in likenes his kinde to multiply,</div>
<div class='line'>As doth in kinde all other things naturally.</div>

<div class='line'>In the time of this said proces naturall,</div>
<div class='line'>While that the sperme conceiued is growing,</div>
<div class='line'>The substance is nourished with his owne menstruall,</div>
<div class='line'>Which water only out of the earth did spring,</div>
<div class='line'>Whose colour is greene in the first showing:</div>
<div class='line'>And from that time the Sunne hid•th his light,</div>
<div class='line'>Taking his course throughout the North by night.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>The sayd menstruall is (I say to thee in counsell)</div>
<div class='line'>The blood of our greene Lyon and not of vitriall▪</div>
<div class='line'>Dame Venus can the troth of this thee tell,</div>
<div class='line'>At the beginning, to counsell if thou her call,</div>
<div class='line'>This secret is hid by Philosophers great and small,</div>
<div class='line'>Which blood drawne out of the greene Lyon,</div>
<div class='line'>For lack of heate had not perfect digestion.</div>

<div class='line'>But this blood called our secreat menstruall,</div>
<div class='line'>Wherewith our sperme is nourished temperately,</div>
<div class='line'>When it is turned into the feces corporall,</div>
<div class='line'>And so become white perfectly and very drye,</div>
<div class='line'>Congeald and fixed into his owne bodie,</div>
<div class='line'>Then biscoct blood to sight it may well seeme,</div>
<div class='line'>Of this worke named the milke white Dyademe.</div>

<div class='line'>Vnderstand now that our firie water thus acuate,</div>
<div class='line'>Is called our menstruall water, wherein</div>
<div class='line'>Our earth is loosed and naturally calcinate,</div>
<div class='line'>By Congelation that they may neuer twinne,</div>
<div class='line'>But yet to congeale more water thou may not linne:</div>
<div class='line'>Into three partes of the acuate water sayd afore,</div>
<div class='line'>With the fourth parte of the earth congealed and no more.</div>

<div class='line'>Vnto that substance therefore so congelate,</div>
<div class='line'>The fourth parte put of water christaline,</div>
<div class='line'>And make them then together to be dispousate,</div>
<div class='line'>By Congelation into a miner metaline,</div>
<div class='line'>Which like a sworde new slipped will shine,</div>
<div class='line'>After the blacknes which first will shew,</div>
<div class='line'>The fourth parte then giue it of water new.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Imbibitions many it must haue yet,</div>
<div class='line'>Giue it the second, and after the third also.</div>
<div class='line'>The sayd proportion keeping in thy witt,</div>
<div class='line'>Then to another the fourth time looke thou goe,</div>
<div class='line'>The fift time and the sixt passe not therefore,</div>
<div class='line'>But put two partes at each time of them three,</div>
<div class='line'>And at the seuenth time fiue partes must there bee.</div>

<div class='line'>When thou hast made seauen times Imbibition,</div>
<div class='line'>Againe then must thou turne about thy wheele,</div>
<div class='line'>And putrifie all that matter without addition,</div>
<div class='line'>First blacknes abiding if thou wilt doe weele,</div>
<div class='line'>Then into whitenes congeale it vp each deele,</div>
<div class='line'>And after by rednes into the south ascend,</div>
<div class='line'>Then hast thou brought thy base vnto an end.</div>

<div class='line'>Thus is thy water then diuided into partes two,</div>
<div class='line'>With the first parte the bodies be putrificate,</div>
<div class='line'>And to thine Imbibitions the second parte must goe,</div>
<div class='line'>With which thy matter is afterwarde demigrate,</div>
<div class='line'>And soone vpon easie decoction albificate,</div>
<div class='line'>Then is it named by Philosophers out starry stone,</div>
<div class='line'>Bring that to rednes then is the sixt gate wonne.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the sixt gate.</div>

<h2>Of Cibation. The seuenth Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>NOw of Cibation I turne my pen to write,</div>
<div class='line'>Sith it must here the seuenth place occupie:</div>
<div class='line'>But in few words it wilbe expedite,</div>
<div class='line'>Take heede therefore, and vnderstand me wittelie;</div>
<div class='line'>Cibation is called a feeding of our matter drie,</div>
<div class='line'>With milke and meate, which moderately thou doe,</div>
<div class='line'>Vntill it be brought the third order vnto.</div>

<div class='line'>But giue it neuer so much, that thou it glut;</div>
<div class='line'>Beware of dropsey, and also of Noahs flood:</div>
<div class='line'>By little and little therefore thou to it put</div>
<div class='line'>Of meate and drinke, as seemes to doo it good,</div>
<div class='line'>That watry humours not ouergrow the blood,</div>
<div class='line'>To drinke therefore let it be measured so,</div>
<div class='line'>That kindly appetite thou neuer quench it fro.</div>

<div class='line'>For if it drinke too much, then must it haue</div>
<div class='line'>A vomit or els it wilbe sick too long,</div>
<div class='line'>From the dropsie therefore thy wombe thou saue,</div>
<div class='line'>And from the fl•x, or els it wilbe wrong,</div>
<div class='line'>But rather let it thirst for drinke among,</div>
<div class='line'>Than thou shouldst giue it ouermuch at once.</div>
<div class='line'>Which must in youth be dieted for the nonce.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And if thou diet it (as nature doth require)</div>
<div class='line'>Moderately, till time that it be growen to age,</div>
<div class='line'>From colde it keeping, and nourishing with moyst fire,</div>
<div class='line'>Then shall it growe, and wexe full of courage,</div>
<div class='line'>And doe to thee both pleasure and aduantage:</div>
<div class='line'>For he shall make darke bodies whole and bright,</div>
<div class='line'>Clensing their leprosies through his might.</div>

<div class='line'>Three times must thou turne about thy wheele,</div>
<div class='line'>Still keeping the rule of the said Cibation,</div>
<div class='line'>And then as soone as it the fire doth feele,</div>
<div class='line'>Like waxe it wilbe readie vnto liquation:</div>
<div class='line'>This chapter needeth no longer protestation,</div>
<div class='line'>For I haue tolde thee the dietorie most conuenient,</div>
<div class='line'>After thine Elements be made equipolent.</div>

<div class='line'>And also how to whitenes thou shalt bring thy golde,</div>
<div class='line'>Most like in figure to leaues of hawthorne tree</div>
<div class='line'>Called Magnesia, afore as I haue tolde,</div>
<div class='line'>And our white Sulphure without combustibilitie,</div>
<div class='line'>Which from the fire away will neuer flie.</div>
<div class='line'>And thus the seuenth Gate (as you desired)</div>
<div class='line'>In the vprising of the Sunne is conquered.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the seuenth Gate.</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Of Sublimation. The eight Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>HEre of our Sublimation a word or two</div>
<div class='line'>I haue to speake, which the eight Gate is.</div>
<div class='line'>Fooles doo sublime, but sublime thou not so,</div>
<div class='line'>For we sublime not as they doe ywis:</div>
<div class='line'>To sublime truly therefore thou shalt not mis,</div>
<div class='line'>If thou canst make thy bodies first spirituall,</div>
<div class='line'>And then thy spirits (as I haue taught thee) corporall.</div>

<div class='line'>Some doe Mercurie from vitrioll and salt sublime,</div>
<div class='line'>And other spirits from scales of yron and steele,</div>
<div class='line'>From egg-shels calcined, and from quick lime,</div>
<div class='line'>And in their manner yet sublime they right weele:</div>
<div class='line'>But such subliming accordeth neuer a deele</div>
<div class='line'>To our intents, for we sublime not so,</div>
<div class='line'>To true subliming therefore, now will I goe.</div>

<div class='line'>In Sublimation first beware of one thing,</div>
<div class='line'>That thou sublime to the top of the vessell:</div>
<div class='line'>For without violence thou shalt it not downe bring</div>
<div class='line'>Againe, but there it will abide and dwell,</div>
<div class='line'>So it reioyceth with refrigeration I thee tell,</div>
<div class='line'>Keepe it therefore with temperate heate adowne</div>
<div class='line'>Full fortie dayes, till it wexe blacke and browne.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>For then the soule beginneth to come out</div>
<div class='line'>From his owne veynes, for all that subtill is</div>
<div class='line'>Will with the spirite ascend withouten doubt,</div>
<div class='line'>Beare in thy minde therefore, and thinke on this,</div>
<div class='line'>How here eclipsed been thy bodies,</div>
<div class='line'>As they doe putrifie subliming more and more</div>
<div class='line'>Into water, vntill they be all vp ybore.</div>

<div class='line'>And thus their venome when they haue spued out</div>
<div class='line'>Into the water then blacke it doth appeare,</div>
<div class='line'>Becomming spirituall each deale without doubt,</div>
<div class='line'>Subliming easilie in our manner,</div>
<div class='line'>Into the water, which doth him beare:</div>
<div class='line'>For in the ayre our childe must thus be bore</div>
<div class='line'>Of the water againe, as I haue said before.</div>

<div class='line'>But when these two by Sublimation continuall</div>
<div class='line'>Be laboured so with heate both moyst and temperate,</div>
<div class='line'>That all is white and purely made spirituall,</div>
<div class='line'>Then heauen vpon earth must be reiterate</div>
<div class='line'>Vntill the soule with the bodie be incorporate</div>
<div class='line'>That earth become all that before was heauen,</div>
<div class='line'>Which wilbe done in Sublimations seauen.</div>

<div class='line'>And Sublimations we make for causes three,</div>
<div class='line'>The first cause is, to make the bodie spirituall;</div>
<div class='line'>The second is, that the spirite may corpora•l bee,</div>
<div class='line'>And become fixt with it, and consubstantiall;</div>
<div class='line'>The third cause is, that from his filthie originall</div>
<div class='line'>He may be cleansed, and his saltnes sulphurious</div>
<div class='line'>May be minished in him, which is infectious.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Then when they thus together depured be,</div>
<div class='line'>They will sublime vp whiter than the snowe▪</div>
<div class='line'>That sight will greatly comfort thee:</div>
<div class='line'>For then anon perfectly thou shalt knowe</div>
<div class='line'>The spirits shall so adowne ythrowe,</div>
<div class='line'>That this eight Gate shalbe to thee vnlocked,</div>
<div class='line'>Out of the which many be shut and mocked.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the eight Gate.</div>

<h2>Of Firmentation. The ninth Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>TRue Firmentation few Workers vnderstand,</div>
<div class='line'>That secret therefore I will expound to thee,</div>
<div class='line'>I trauailed truly through manie a Land,</div>
<div class='line'>Ere euer I might finde any that would tell it mee:</div>
<div class='line'>Yet as God would, euermore blessed be hee,</div>
<div class='line'>At the last I came to the knowledge thereof perfite,</div>
<div class='line'>Take heede therefore what I thereof doe write.</div>

<div class='line'>Firmentations in diuers manners be doone,</div>
<div class='line'>By which our medicine must be perpetuate</div>
<div class='line'>Into cleere water: some looseth Sunne and Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>And with their medicines make them to be congelate;</div>
<div class='line'>Which in the fire when they be examinate</div>
<div class='line'>May not abide, nor alter with complement:</div>
<div class='line'>For such Firmenting is not to our intent.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But yet more kindly some other men doone,</div>
<div class='line'>Fermenting their medicines in this wise,</div>
<div class='line'>In Mercurie dissoluing both Sunne and Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>Till time with the spirit they will arise,</div>
<div class='line'>Subliming them together twice or thrice;</div>
<div class='line'>Then Fermentation therewith they make:</div>
<div class='line'>That is a way, but yet we it forsake.</div>

<div class='line'>Some other there be which haue more hap,</div>
<div class='line'>To touch the troth in part of fermenting,</div>
<div class='line'>They amalgame their bodies with Mercurie like pap,</div>
<div class='line'>Then therevpon their medicines relenting:</div>
<div class='line'>These of our secrets haue some henting.</div>
<div class='line'>But not the truth with perfect complement,</div>
<div class='line'>Because they neither putrifie, nor alter their Ferment.</div>

<div class='line'>That poynt therefore I will disclose vnto thee,</div>
<div class='line'>Looke how thou didst with thine vnperfect bodie,</div>
<div class='line'>Doe so with thy perfect bodies in each degree,</div>
<div class='line'>That is to say, first thou them putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>Their former qualities destroying vtterly,</div>
<div class='line'>For this is wholly to our intent,</div>
<div class='line'>That first thou alter before thou ferment.</div>

<div class='line'>To thy compound make firment the fourth part,</div>
<div class='line'>Which ferments been only of Sunne and Moone;</div>
<div class='line'>If thou therefore be maister of this Arte,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy Fermentation let thus be doone,</div>
<div class='line'>Fixe water and earth together soone,</div>
<div class='line'>And when thy medicine as waxe doth flowe,</div>
<div class='line'>Then vpon malgames looke thou it throwe.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And when all that together is mixed,</div>
<div class='line'>Aboue the glasse well closed make thy fire,</div>
<div class='line'>And so continue it till all be fixed,</div>
<div class='line'>And well fermented to thy defire,</div>
<div class='line'>Then make Proiection after thy pleasure,</div>
<div class='line'>For that is medicine each deale perfite,</div>
<div class='line'>Thus must thou ferment both red and white.</div>

<div class='line'>For like as flowre of wheate made into paste</div>
<div class='line'>Requireth ferment, which leauen we call</div>
<div class='line'>Of bread, that it may haue the kindly taste,</div>
<div class='line'>And become foode to man and woman cordiall:</div>
<div class='line'>Right so thy medicine ferment thou shall,</div>
<div class='line'>That it may taste of the Ferment pure,</div>
<div class='line'>At all assayes for euer to endure.</div>

<div class='line'>And vnderstand that there be Ferments three,</div>
<div class='line'>Two be of bodies in nature cleene,</div>
<div class='line'>Which must be altred as I haue told thee;</div>
<div class='line'>The third most secret of which I meene,</div>
<div class='line'>Is the first earth of his water greene:</div>
<div class='line'>And therefore when the Lion doth thurst,</div>
<div class='line'>Make him to drinke till his belly burst.</div>

<div class='line'>Of this a Question if I should mooue,</div>
<div class='line'>And aske of workers, what is this thing?</div>
<div class='line'>Anon thereby I should them prooue,</div>
<div class='line'>If they had knowledge of our fermenting:</div>
<div class='line'>For manie a man speaketh with wondring,</div>
<div class='line'>Of Robin hood and of his bowe,</div>
<div class='line'>Which neuer shot therein I trowe.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>For Fermentation true as I thee tell,</div>
<div class='line'>Is of the soule with the bodies incorporation,</div>
<div class='line'>Restoring to it the kindly smell,</div>
<div class='line'>With tast and colour by naturall conspissation,</div>
<div class='line'>Of things disseuered, a due reintegration,</div>
<div class='line'>Whereby the bodie of the spirit taketh impression,</div>
<div class='line'>That either the other may help to haue ingression.</div>

<div class='line'>For like as bodies in their compaction corporall,</div>
<div class='line'>May not shewe out their qualities effectually,</div>
<div class='line'>Vntill the time that they become spirituall,</div>
<div class='line'>No more may spirits abide with bodies stedfastly,</div>
<div class='line'>Till they with them be confixate proportionally,</div>
<div class='line'>For then the bodie teacheth the spirit to suffer fire,</div>
<div class='line'>And the spirit the bodie to enter to thy defire.</div>

<div class='line'>Therefore thy gold with gold thou must ferment,</div>
<div class='line'>With his owne water thy earth cleansed I meene,</div>
<div class='line'>Nought else to say but element with element,</div>
<div class='line'>The spirit of life onely going betweene,</div>
<div class='line'>For like as an adamant as thou hast seene</div>
<div class='line'>Draweth yron to him, so doth our earth by kinde,</div>
<div class='line'>Drawe downe to him his soule borne vp with winde.</div>

<div class='line'>With winde therefore the soule lead out and in,</div>
<div class='line'>Mingle gold with gold, that is for to say,</div>
<div class='line'>Make Element with Element togetherrin</div>
<div class='line'>Till time all fire they suffer may,</div>
<div class='line'>For earth is Ferment withouten nay</div>
<div class='line'>To water, and water the earth vnto,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Fermentatio• in this wise must be doe.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Earth is gold, and so is the soule also</div>
<div class='line'>Not common, but ours thus Elementate,</div>
<div class='line'>And yet thereto the Sunne must goe,</div>
<div class='line'>That by our wheele it may be alterate:</div>
<div class='line'>For so to ferment it must be preparate,</div>
<div class='line'>That it profoundly may ioyned bee,</div>
<div class='line'>With other natures as I said to thee.</div>

<div class='line'>And whatsoeuer I haue here said of gold,</div>
<div class='line'>The same of siluer I will thou vnderstand,</div>
<div class='line'>That thou them putrifie and alter (as I haue told)</div>
<div class='line'>Ere thou thy medicine to firment take in hand:</div>
<div class='line'>Forsooth I could neuer finde him in England</div>
<div class='line'>Which in this wise to firment could me teach</div>
<div class='line'>Withouten error, by practise or by speach.</div>

<div class='line'>Now of this chapter needeth to treate no more,</div>
<div class='line'>Sith I intend prolixitie to eschew;</div>
<div class='line'>Remember well my words therefore,</div>
<div class='line'>Which thou shalt proue by practise trew,</div>
<div class='line'>And Sunne and Moone looke thou renew,</div>
<div class='line'>That they may hold of the fift nature,</div>
<div class='line'>Then shall their tincture euermore endure.</div>

<div class='line'>And yet a way there is most excellent,</div>
<div class='line'>Belonging vnto another working,</div>
<div class='line'>A water we make most redolent,</div>
<div class='line'>All bodies to oyle wherewith we bring,</div>
<div class='line'>With which our medicine we make flowing,</div>
<div class='line'>A quintessence this water we call,</div>
<div class='line'>In man which healeth diseases all.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But with thy base, after my doctrine preperate</div>
<div class='line'>Which is our calx this must be done,</div>
<div class='line'>For when our bodies be so calcinate,</div>
<div class='line'>That water will to oyle dissolue them soone,</div>
<div class='line'>Make thou therefore oyle both of Sunne and Moone,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is ferment most fragrant for to smell.</div>
<div class='line'>And so the ninth gate is conquered of this Castell.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the ninth Gate.</div>

<h2>Of Exaltation. The tenth Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>PRoceede we now to the chapter of Exaltation,</div>
<div class='line'>Of which truly thou must haue knowledge pure,</div>
<div class='line'>But little it is different from Sublimation,</div>
<div class='line'>If thou conceiue it right I you ensure,</div>
<div class='line'>Hereto accordeth the holy scripture,</div>
<div class='line'>Christ saying thus, if I exalted be,</div>
<div class='line'>Then shall I draw all things vnto me.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Our medicine if we exalt right so,</div>
<div class='line'>It shalbe thereby nobilitate,</div>
<div class='line'>That must be done in manners two,</div>
<div class='line'>From time the parties be dispousate,</div>
<div class='line'>Which must be crucified and examinate,</div>
<div class='line'>And then contumulate both man and wife,</div>
<div class='line'>And after reuiued by the spirit of life.</div>

<div class='line'>Then vp to heauen they must exalted be,</div>
<div class='line'>There to be in bodie and soule glorificate,</div>
<div class='line'>For thou must bring them to such subtiltie,</div>
<div class='line'>that they ascend together to be intronizate,</div>
<div class='line'>In cloudes of clearenes to Angels consociate,</div>
<div class='line'>Then shall they draw as thou shalt see,</div>
<div class='line'>Al other bodies to their owne dignitee.</div>

<div class='line'>If thou therefore the bodies wilt exalt,</div>
<div class='line'>First with the spirit of life thou them augment,</div>
<div class='line'>till time the earth be well subtilizate,</div>
<div class='line'>By naturall rectifying of euery Element,</div>
<div class='line'>Them vp exalting into the firmament,</div>
<div class='line'>Then much more precious shall they be than gold,</div>
<div class='line'>Because of the quintessence which they doe holde.</div>

<div class='line'>For when the colde hath ouercome the heate,</div>
<div class='line'>Then into water the Ayre shall turned be,</div>
<div class='line'>And so two contraries together shall meete,</div>
<div class='line'>Till either with orher right well agree,</div>
<div class='line'>So into Ayre the water as I tell thee,</div>
<div class='line'>When heate of colde hath got domination,</div>
<div class='line'>Shall be conuerted by craft of our circulation.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And of the Ayre then fire haue thou shall,</div>
<div class='line'>By loosing putrifying and subliming,</div>
<div class='line'>And fire thou hast of the earth materiall,</div>
<div class='line'>Thine Elements thus by craft disseuering,</div>
<div class='line'>Most especially thine earth well calcining,</div>
<div class='line'>And when they be each one made pure,</div>
<div class='line'>Then doe they holde all of the first nature.</div>

<div class='line'>On this wise therefore make them be circulate,</div>
<div class='line'>Each into other exalting by and by,</div>
<div class='line'>And all in this one glasse surely sigillate,</div>
<div class='line'>Not with thine hands, but as I teach thee naturally,</div>
<div class='line'>Fire into water then turne first hardly,</div>
<div class='line'>For fire is in Ayre, which is in water existent,</div>
<div class='line'>And this conuersion accordeth to our intent.</div>

<div class='line'>Then furthermore turne on thy wheele,</div>
<div class='line'>That into earth the ayre conuerted be,</div>
<div class='line'>Which will be done also right well,</div>
<div class='line'>For Ayre is in water being in earth trust me,</div>
<div class='line'>The water into fire contrarious in her qualitie,</div>
<div class='line'>Soone turne thou mayst for water in earth is,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is in fire, conuersion true is this.</div>

<div class='line'>The wheele is now neere turned about,</div>
<div class='line'>Into ayre turne earrh which is the proper nest,</div>
<div class='line'>Of other Elements there is no doubt,</div>
<div class='line'>For earth in fire is, which in ayre taketh rest,</div>
<div class='line'>This circulation beginne thou in the west,</div>
<div class='line'>Then into the south, till they exalted bee,</div>
<div class='line'>Proceede duely, as in thy figure I haue taught thee.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>In which processe clearely thou mayst see,</div>
<div class='line'>Frō one extreame how to another thou mayst not go,</div>
<div class='line'>But by a meane, since they in qualities contrarious be,</div>
<div class='line'>And reason will forsooth that it be so,</div>
<div class='line'>As heate into colde, with other contraries •o,</div>
<div class='line'>Without their meanes as moyst to heate and colde,</div>
<div class='line'>Examples sufficient before this I haue tolde.</div>

<div class='line'>Thus haue I taught thee how to make</div>
<div class='line'>Of all thine Elements a perfect circulation,</div>
<div class='line'>And at thy figure example to take,</div>
<div class='line'>How thou shalt make this foresaide Exaltation,</div>
<div class='line'>And of thy medicine in the Elements true graduation,</div>
<div class='line'>Till it be brought to a gueneritie temperate,</div>
<div class='line'>And then thou hast conquered the tenth gate.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the tenth Gate.</div>

<h2>Of Multiplication. The eleuenth Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>MVltiplication now to declare I proceede,</div>
<div class='line'>Which is by Philosophers in this wise defined</div>
<div class='line'>Augmentation it is of the Elixer indeede,</div>
<div class='line'>In goodnes and quantitie both for white and red,</div>
<div class='line'>Multiplication is therefore as they doe write,</div>
<div class='line'>That thing that doth augmēt medicines in each degree,</div>
<div class='line'>In colour, in odour, in vertue and also in quantitee.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And why thou mayst this medicine multiplie,</div>
<div class='line'>Infinitely forsooth the cause is this,</div>
<div class='line'>For it is fire, which kindled will neuer die,</div>
<div class='line'>Dwelling with thee, as fire doth in houses,</div>
<div class='line'>Of which one sparke may make more fire ywis,</div>
<div class='line'>As muske in pigments and other spices mo,</div>
<div class='line'>In vertue multiplied, and our medicine right so.</div>

<div class='line'>So he is rich which fire hath lesse or more,</div>
<div class='line'>Because he may so hugely it multiply,</div>
<div class='line'>And right so rich is he which any parte hath in store,</div>
<div class='line'>Of our Elixers which be augmentable infinitely,</div>
<div class='line'>One way if thou dissolue our pouders drye,</div>
<div class='line'>And make often times of them Congelation,</div>
<div class='line'>Thereof in goodnes then makest thou Augmentation.</div>

<div class='line'>The second way both in goodnes and quantitie,</div>
<div class='line'>It multiplyeth by iterate Fermentation,</div>
<div class='line'>As in that chapter I shewed plainely to thee,</div>
<div class='line'>By diuers manners of naturall operation,</div>
<div class='line'>And also in the chapter of our Cibation,</div>
<div class='line'>Where thou mayst know how thou shalt multiplie,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy medicine with Mercurie infinitely.</div>

<div class='line'>But and thou wilt both loose and eke ferment,</div>
<div class='line'>Both more in quantitie and better will it be:</div>
<div class='line'>And in such wise thou mayst it soone augment,</div>
<div class='line'>That in thy glasse it will growe like a tree,</div>
<div class='line'>The tree of Hermes named seemely to see,</div>
<div class='line'>Of which one pippin a thousand will multiplie,</div>
<div class='line'>If thou canst make thy proiection wittely.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And like as Saffron when it is puluerizate,</div>
<div class='line'>By little and little if it with liquor be</div>
<div class='line'>Tempred, and then with much more liquor dilate,</div>
<div class='line'>Teyneth much more of liquor in quantitie,</div>
<div class='line'>Thā being whole in his grosse nature: so shalt thou see,</div>
<div class='line'>That our Elixer, the more it is made thinne,</div>
<div class='line'>The further in tincture it fastly will rinne.</div>

<div class='line'>Keepe in thy fire therefore both euen and morrow,</div>
<div class='line'>From house to house that thou neede not to rinne,</div>
<div class='line'>Among thy neighbours thy fire to seeke or borrow,</div>
<div class='line'>The more thou keepest, the more good shalt thou win</div>
<div class='line'>Multiplying it alwaies more & more thy glasse within,</div>
<div class='line'>By feeding with Mercurie vnto thy liues end,</div>
<div class='line'>So shalt thou haue more than thou needest to spend.</div>

<div class='line'>This matter is plaine I will no more</div>
<div class='line'>Write thereof, let reason thee guide,</div>
<div class='line'>Be neuer the bolder to sinne therefore,</div>
<div class='line'>But serue thy God the better in each tide:</div>
<div class='line'>And while that thou shalt in this life abide,</div>
<div class='line'>Beare this in minde, forget not I thee pray,</div>
<div class='line'>As thou shalt appeare before God at domes day.</div>

<div class='line'>His owne great giftes therefore and his treasure,</div>
<div class='line'>Dispose thou vertuously, helping the poore at neede,</div>
<div class='line'>That in this world thou mayst to thee procure,</div>
<div class='line'>Mercy and grace with heauenly blisse to meede,</div>
<div class='line'>And pray to God deuoutly that he thee leade,</div>
<div class='line'>In at the twelfth gate, as he can best,</div>
<div class='line'>Soone after then thou shalt end thy conquest.</div>

<div class='line'>The end of the eleuenth gate.</div>

<hr/>

<h2>Of Proiection. The twelfth Gate.</h2>

<div class='line'>IN Proiection it shal be proued if our practise be pro∣fitable,</div>
<div class='line'>Of which it behoueth me the secrets here to moue,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore if thy tincture be sure and not variable,</div>
<div class='line'>By a little of thy medicine thus mayst thou proue,</div>
<div class='line'>With mettle, or with Mercury as pitch it will cleaue,</div>
<div class='line'>And teyne in Proiection all fires to abide,</div>
<div class='line'>And soone it will enter and spread him full wide.</div>

<div class='line'>But many by ignorance doe marre that they made,</div>
<div class='line'>When on mettals vnclensed Proiection they make,</div>
<div class='line'>For because of corruption their tinctures must fade,</div>
<div class='line'>Which they would not away first from the body take,</div>
<div class='line'>Which after Proiection be brittle blew and black,</div>
<div class='line'>That thy tincture therefore may euermore last,</div>
<div class='line'>First vpon ferment thy medicine see thou cast.</div>

<div class='line'>Then brittle as glasse will thy ferment bee,</div>
<div class='line'>Vpon bodies clensed and made very pure,</div>
<div class='line'>Cast that brittle substance and soone shalt thou see,</div>
<div class='line'>That they shall be curiously coloured with tincture,</div>
<div class='line'>With all assayes for euer shall endure,</div>
<div class='line'>But profitable Proiection perfectly to make,</div>
<div class='line'>At the Psalmes of the Psalter example thou take.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>On Fundamenta cast first this psalme Nunc di••ittis,</div>
<div class='line'>Vpon verba mea, then cast Fundamenta beliue,</div>
<div class='line'>Then Verba vpon diligam, conceiue me with thy wits.</div>
<div class='line'>And diligam vpon attendite, if thou list to thriue,</div>
<div class='line'>Thus make thou Proiections, three, foure, or fiue,</div>
<div class='line'>Till the tincture of the medicine beginne to decrease,</div>
<div class='line'>And then it is time of Proiection to cease.</div>

<div class='line'>By this mistie talking I meane nothing else,</div>
<div class='line'>But that thou must cast first the lesse on the more,</div>
<div class='line'>Encreasing aye the number as wisemen thee tells,</div>
<div class='line'>And keepe thou this secreat vnto thy selfe in store,</div>
<div class='line'>Be couetous of cunning it is no burden sore,</div>
<div class='line'>For he that ioyneth not the Elixer with bodies made cleane,</div>
<div class='line'>He wotteth not surely what Proiection doth meane</div>

<div class='line'>Ten if thou multiplie first into ten,</div>
<div class='line'>One hundreth that number maketh sickerly,</div>
<div class='line'>If one hundreth into an hundreth be multiplied, then</div>
<div class='line'>Ten thousand is that number if thou count it wittely,</div>
<div class='line'>Then into as much more ten thousand to multiplie,</div>
<div class='line'>It is a thousand thousand; which multiplied ywis,</div>
<div class='line'>Into as much more a hundreth millions is.</div>

<div class='line'>That hundreth millions being multiplyed likewise</div>
<div class='line'>Into ten thousand millions, as I to thee doe say,</div>
<div class='line'>Maketh so great a number I wot not what it is,</div>
<div class='line'>Thy number in Proiection thus multiplye alway:</div>
<div class='line'>Now childe of thy curtesie for me that thou pray,</div>
<div class='line'>Sith I haue tolde thee our secrets all and some,</div>
<div class='line'>To the which I beseech GOD by grace thou mayst come.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Now hast thou conquered these gates twelue,</div>
<div class='line'>And all the Castle thou holdest at thy will,</div>
<div class='line'>Keepe thy secreats in store to thy selfe,</div>
<div class='line'>And the commaundements of God looke thou fulfill,</div>
<div class='line'>In fire see thou continue thy glasses still,</div>
<div class='line'>And multiply thy medicines aye more and more,</div>
<div class='line'>For wise men doe say, that store is no sore.</div>

<div class='line'>Recapitulatio totius operis praedicti.</div>
<div class='line'>For to bring this Treatise to a finall ende,</div>
<div class='line'>And briefly here to conclude these secrets all,</div>
<div class='line'>Diligently looke thou, and to thy figure attend,</div>
<div class='line'>Which doth in it containe these secrets great & small,</div>
<div class='line'>And if thou it conceiue, both theoricall and practicall,</div>
<div class='line'>By figures and colours, by scripture plaine,</div>

<div class='line'>It wittily conceiued, thou mayst not worke in vaine.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Consider first the latitude of this precious Stone,</div>
<div class='line'>Beginning in the first side noted in the West,</div>
<div class='line'>Where the red man & the white woman be made one,</div>
<div class='line'>Spoused with the spirite of life to liue in rest,</div>
<div class='line'>Earth and water equally proportionate, that is best,</div>
<div class='line'>And one of the earth is good, and of the spirit three,</div>
<div class='line'>Which twelue to fowre also of the earth may bee.</div>

<div class='line'>Three of the wife, and one of the man thou take,</div>
<div class='line'>And the lesse of the spirit in this dispousation,</div>
<div class='line'>The rather thy Calcination for certain shalt thou make:</div>
<div class='line'>Then forth into the North proceed by obscuration</div>
<div class='line'>Of the red man and his white wife, called Eclipsation,</div>
<div class='line'>Loosing them and altring them betwixt winter & vere,</div>
<div class='line'>Into water turning earth, darke and nothing cleare.</div>

<div class='line'>From thence by colours many one into the East ascend,</div>
<div class='line'>Then shall the Moone be full appearing by day-light,</div>
<div class='line'>Then is she passed purgatorie, and her course at an end,</div>
<div class='line'>There is the vprising of the Sunne appearing bright.</div>
<div class='line'>There is Summer after Vere, and day after night:</div>
<div class='line'>Thē earth & water which wer black, be turned to aire,</div>
<div class='line'>And clouds of darknes ouerblown, & all apeareth faire.</div>

<div class='line'>And as in the west was the beginning of thy practise.</div>
<div class='line'>And the North the perfect meane of profoūd alteratiō:</div>
<div class='line'>So in the East after them the beginning of speculatiō is:</div>
<div class='line'>But of this course vp in the south the sun maketh cōsū∣matiō.</div>
<div class='line'>Ther bin the elements turned into fire by circulatiō:</div>
<div class='line'>Then to win to thy desire thou needst not be in doubt,</div>
<div class='line'>For the wheele of our philosophie thou hast turned a∣bout</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But yet about againe two times turne thy wheele,</div>
<div class='line'>In which bin cōprehēded all the secrets of our philoso∣phy.</div>
<div class='line'>In chapiters 12. made plaine to thee, if thou cōceiue thē well,</div>
<div class='line'>And all the secrets by & by of our lower Astronomy,</div>
<div class='line'>How thou shalt calcine bodies, perfit, dissolue diuide & putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>With perfect knowledge of all the poles which in our heauen beene,</div>
<div class='line'>Shining with colours inexplicable, neuer were gayer seene.</div>

<div class='line'>And thus our secret conclusion know withouten faile,</div>
<div class='line'>Our red man teineth not, nor his wife, til they teined be,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore if thou list thy selfe by this craft to auaile,</div>
<div class='line'>The altitude of the bodies hide, & shewe out their pro∣funditie,</div>
<div class='line'>In euery of thy materials destroying the first qualitie,</div>
<div class='line'>And secondary qualities more glorious in them repaire anone,</div>
<div class='line'>And in one glasse, and with one rule, foure natures turn to one.</div>

<div class='line'>Pale & black with false citrine, imperfect white & red,</div>
<div class='line'>The Peacocks feathers in colours gay, the Rainebowe which shall ouergoe,</div>
<div class='line'>The spotted pāther, the lyō green, the crowes bil blue as lead,</div>
<div class='line'>These shall apeare before thee perfect white, and manie other moe,</div>
<div class='line'>And after the perfect white, gray, false citrine also,</div>
<div class='line'>And after these, thē shall apeare the body red inuariable,</div>
<div class='line'>Then hast thou a medicine of the thirde order of his owne kinde multiplicable.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Thou must diuide thy white Elixer into parts two</div>
<div class='line'>Before thou rubifie, & into glasses two let thē be doone.</div>
<div class='line'>If thou wilt haue for Sū & moon thy elixer both do so;</div>
<div class='line'>And into mercury thē multiply to great quātity soone,</div>
<div class='line'>And if thou had not at the beginning to fill a spoone,</div>
<div class='line'>Yet maist thou them so multiply both white and red.</div>
<div class='line'>That if thou liue a 1000. yeres, they shall stād thee in sted.</div>

<div class='line'>Haue thou recourse to thy wheele therefore I counsell thee,</div>
<div class='line'>And studie him well to know in each chapter truly,</div>
<div class='line'>Meddle with no phantasticall multipliers, but let thē be,</div>
<div class='line'>Which will thee flatter feining them cunning in Phi∣losophie,</div>
<div class='line'>Doe as I bid thee, thē dissolue these foresaid bases wit∣tilie,</div>
<div class='line'>And turne them into perfect oyles with our true water ardent,</div>
<div class='line'>By circulation that must be done according to our in∣tent.</div>

<div class='line'>These oyles will fixe crude Mercurie and conuert bo∣dies all</div>
<div class='line'>Into perfect Sunne and Moone, when thou shalt make Proiection;</div>
<div class='line'>That oylie substance pure & fixt Raimond Lully did call</div>
<div class='line'>His Basiliske, of which he neuer made so plain detectiō:</div>
<div class='line'>Pray for me to God, that I may be one of his election,</div>
<div class='line'>And that he will for one of his, at doomesday me ken▪</div>
<div class='line'>And graunt me his blisse to raigne with him for euer. Amen.</div>

<div class='line'>Finis Recapitulationis.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>An Admonition, wherein the Author declareth his erronious Experiments.</div>
<div class='line'>AFter all this, I will thou vnderstand</div>
<div class='line'>For thy sauegard, what I haue doone,</div>
<div class='line'>Manie experiments haue I taken in hand</div>
<div class='line'>As I found written for Sunne and Moone:</div>
<div class='line'>The which I will tell thee, rehearsing soone,</div>
<div class='line'>Beginning at the vermilion, which proued nought,</div>

<div class='line'>And Mercurie sublimed, which I dearly bought.</div>
<div class='line'>I made solutions full manie a one</div>
<div class='line'>Of spirits, ferments, salts, yron, and steele,</div>
<div class='line'>Weening so to make the Philosophers Stone:</div>
<div class='line'>But finally I lost euery deele,</div>
<div class='line'>After my bookes yet wrought I weele,</div>
<div class='line'>Which euermore vntrue I preeued,</div>

<div class='line'>Which made me oft full sore agreeued.</div>
<div class='line'>Waters corsiue and waters ardent,</div>
<div class='line'>With which I wrought in diuers wise,</div>
<div class='line'>Manie one I made, but all were shent,</div>
<div class='line'>Egg-shells I calcined twice or thrise,</div>
<div class='line'>Oyles from Calxes I made vp to rise,</div>
<div class='line'>And euery Element I did from other twin,</div>

<div class='line'>But profit found I none therein.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Also I wrought in sulphure and vitriall,</div>
<div class='line'>Which fooles doe call the greene Lyon,</div>
<div class='line'>In Arsinike, in orpiment, foule them befall,</div>
<div class='line'>In debili principio was my inception,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore in fine, was fraude my conclusion:</div>
<div class='line'>And thus I blew my thrift at the cole,</div>
<div class='line'>My cloathes were bawdie, my stomacke neuer whole.</div>

<div class='line'>Sal Armoniacke, and Sandiuere,</div>
<div class='line'>Sal Alcalie, Sal allembroke, and Sal attinckarre,</div>
<div class='line'>Sal tartar, salt common, Sal gem most cleare,</div>
<div class='line'>Salt Peter, salt sod, of these beware,</div>
<div class='line'>And from the odour of quicksiluer keepe thee farre,</div>
<div class='line'>Meddle not with Mercurie precipitate,</div>
<div class='line'>Neither with imperfect bodies rubificate.</div>

<div class='line'>I prooued vrine, eggs, haire and blood,</div>
<div class='line'>The soule of Saturne, and also of markazite,</div>
<div class='line'>Aes vst, and Crokefeere, which did me neuer good,</div>
<div class='line'>And the scales of yron which Smithes of smite,</div>
<div class='line'>Litarge and Antimonie, not worth a mite;</div>
<div class='line'>Of the which gay tinctures did I shew,</div>
<div class='line'>Both red and white, which were vntrew.</div>

<div class='line'>Oyle of lyme, and water with labour great</div>
<div class='line'>I made, calcining it with salt preperate,</div>
<div class='line'>And by it selfe with violent heate,</div>
<div class='line'>Grinding with vineger till I was fatigate,</div>
<div class='line'>And also with aqua vitae, with spices acuate</div>
<div class='line'>Vpon a marble Stone, which stood me in cost,</div>
<div class='line'>And oyles with corosiues I made; but all was lost.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Manie a Malgame did I make,</div>
<div class='line'>Weening to fixe them to great auaile,</div>
<div class='line'>And thereto Sulphure did I take,</div>
<div class='line'>Tartar, egges, whites, and oyle of the snayle,</div>
<div class='line'>But euer of my purpose did I faile,</div>
<div class='line'>For what for the more, and what for the las,</div>
<div class='line'>Euermore something wanting there was.</div>

<div class='line'>Wine and milke, oyles and rennyt,</div>
<div class='line'>The slyme of starres that fall on ground,</div>
<div class='line'>Celedonie with Secundines and many mo yet;</div>
<div class='line'>In these I practised as I in bookes found,</div>
<div class='line'>I wan right nought, but lost many a pound,</div>
<div class='line'>Of Mercurie and mettalls I made christall stones,</div>
<div class='line'>Weening it had been a worke for the nones.</div>

<div class='line'>Thus I rosted and broyled, as one of Gebers cookes,</div>
<div class='line'>Oft times in the asshes my winning I sought,</div>
<div class='line'>For I was deceiued by manie false bookes,</div>
<div class='line'>Whereby vntruth truly I wrought,</div>
<div class='line'>But all such experiments auailed me right nought,</div>
<div class='line'>But brought me in danger and encumbrance,</div>
<div class='line'>By losse of my goods and other greeuance.</div>

<div class='line'>For the loue of our Ladie such lewdnes eschew,</div>
<div class='line'>And medle with no falshood, that neuer proued weele,</div>
<div class='line'>Assay when thee liketh, and thou shalt finde it trew,</div>
<div class='line'>Winne shalt thou right nought, but lose euerie deele,</div>
<div class='line'>Pence in thy purse pawtner few shalt thou feele,</div>

<div class='line'>I sawe neuer true worke truly but one,</div>
<div class='line'>Of which in this Treatise the truth I haue told:</div>
<div class='line'>Studie only therefore how to make our Stone,</div>
<div class='line'>For thereby maist thou winne both siluer and gold,</div>
<div class='line'>Vpon my writing therefore, to ground thee be bold:</div>
<div class='line'>So shalt thou loose nought if God be thy guide,</div>
<div class='line'>Trust to my doctrine, and thereby abide.</div>

<div class='line'>Remember that Man is most noble creature</div>
<div class='line'>Of earthly composition, that euer God wrought,</div>
<div class='line'>In whō is the foure Elements, proportioned by nature,</div>
<div class='line'>A naturall Mercurialitie, which costeth right nought,</div>
<div class='line'>One of his myner by arte it is brought;</div>
<div class='line'>For our mettalls be nought els but our myners two,</div>
<div class='line'>Of Sunne and Moone, wise Raymond said so.</div>

<div class='line'>The clearnes of the Moone, and of the Sunne so bright,</div>
<div class='line'>Into these two myners descendeth secretly,</div>
<div class='line'>Howbeit the clearnes is hid from thy sight,</div>
<div class='line'>Which by craft thou shalt make it to appeare openly:</div>
<div class='line'>This hid Stone, this one thing therefore putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>And wash him in his owne broth till white he become;</div>
<div class='line'>Then ferment him wittily; loe here is all and some.</div>

<div class='line'>Now to God Almightie I thee commend,</div>
<div class='line'>Who graunt thee grace to knowe this one thing;</div>
<div class='line'>For now is this Treatise brought to an end:</div>
<div class='line'>And God for his mercie to his blisse vs bring,</div>

<div class='line'>The Epistle by the same Author written to King Edward the 4.</div>
<div class='line'>O Honorable Lord, and most victorious Knight,</div>
<div class='line'>With grace and vertue abundantly endewed,</div>
<div class='line'>The safegard of England, and maintainer of right;</div>
<div class='line'>That God you loueth, indeed he hath well shewed:</div>
<div class='line'>Wherefore I trust this land shalbe renewed</div>
<div class='line'>With ioy and riches, with charitie and peace,</div>

<div class='line'>So that olde ranckors new vnderstrewed,</div>
<div class='line'>Tempestuous troubles, and wretchednes shall cease.</div>
<div class='line'>And therefore sith I see by tokens right euident,</div>
<div class='line'>That God you guideth, and how that you be vertuous,</div>
<div class='line'>Hating sinne, and all such as be insolent,</div>
<div class='line'>How that also manslaughter to you is odious,</div>
<div class='line'>Vpon the iudgement also that you be piteous:</div>

<div class='line'>Me seemeth ruthe it were but that you should liue long;</div>
<div class='line'>For of your great fortune you are not presumptuous,</div>
<div class='line'>Nor vengeable of spirit to reuenge you of each wrong.</div>
<div class='line'>These considered with others in your most noble State,</div>
<div class='line'>Like as God knoweth, and people doe witnes beare,</div>
<div class='line'>So entirely me m•oueth, that I must algate</div>
<div class='line'>Record the same, and therein be no flatterer:</div>

<div class='line'>And not that only, but also to write here</div>
<div class='line'>Vnto your Highnes, humbly to present</div>
<div class='line'>Great secrets, which infarre countries I did learne,</div>
<div class='line'>And which by grace to me most vnworthie are lent.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Once to your Lordship such things I did promise,</div>
<div class='line'>What time you did commaund to send vnto me,</div>
<div class='line'>And sith that I wrote it in secret wise,</div>
<div class='line'>Vnto your grace from the Vniuersitie</div>
<div class='line'>Of Louaine, when God fortuned me by grace to see</div>
<div class='line'>Greater secrets and much more perfite,</div>
<div class='line'>Which onely to you I will disclosed to be,</div>

<div class='line'>That is the great Elixer both red and white.</div>
<div class='line'>For like it you to trust that truly I haue found,</div>
<div class='line'>The perfect way of most secret Alchymie,</div>
<div class='line'>Which I will neuer truly for marke nor for pound</div>
<div class='line'>Make common but to you, and that conditionally,</div>
<div class='line'>That to youre selfe you shall keepe it full secretly,</div>
<div class='line'>And only to vse it as may be to Gods pleasure,</div>

<div class='line'>Else in time comming to God I should abye,</div>
<div class='line'>For my discouering of his secret treasure.</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore be you well aduised and with good deliberation,</div>
<div class='line'>For of this secret shall know no other creature,</div>
<div class='line'>But onely you as J make faithfull protestation,</div>
<div class='line'>For all the time that herein life J shall endure,</div>
<div class='line'>Whereto J will your Lordship me ensure,</div>

<div class='line'>To my desire in this my oath for to agree,</div>
<div class='line'>Least I to me the wrath of God procure,</div>
<div class='line'>For such reuealing of his great gift and priuitie.</div>
<div class='line'>If God fortune you by me to win this treasure,</div>
<div class='line'>Serue him deuowtly with more lawde and thanking,</div>
<div class='line'>Praying his Godhead in life that you may so endure,</div>
<div class='line'>His gifts of grace, and fortune to vse to his pleasing,</div>

<div class='line'>Most especially intending ouer all thing,</div>
<div class='line'>To your power and cunning his precepts ten</div>
<div class='line'>So to obserue, that into no danger your selfe you bring,</div>
<div class='line'>But that you in glory may see him hereafter, Amen.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And yet moreouer I will your Lordship to pardon me,</div>
<div class='line'>For openly with pen I will it neuer it write,</div>
<div class='line'>But whensoeuer you list by practise you shall see,</div>
<div class='line'>By mouth also this precious secret, most of delight,</div>
<div class='line'>How may be made perfect Elixers both red and white,</div>
<div class='line'>Plaine vnto your Lordship it shall declared be,</div>
<div class='line'>And if it please you, with easie expences and respite,</div>

<div class='line'>I will them worke by grace of the Trinitie.</div>
<div class='line'>But notwithstanding for perill that may befall,</div>
<div class='line'>If I dare not here plainely the knotte vnbinde,</div>
<div class='line'>Yet in my writing I will not be so misticall,</div>
<div class='line'>But that by studie the true knowledge you may finde,</div>
<div class='line'>How that each thing is multiplied in his kinde,</div>
<div class='line'>And how the likenes of bodies metaline be transmutable</div>

<div class='line'>I will declare, that if you feele me in your minde,</div>
<div class='line'>My writing you shall finde true and no fained fable.</div>
<div class='line'>As Philosophers in the m•the•rs doe write,</div>
<div class='line'>The likenes of bodies mataline be not transmutable,</div>
<div class='line'>But after he added these wordes of more delight,</div>
<div class='line'>Without they be reduced to their beginning materiable,</div>
<div class='line'>Wherefore such bodies within nature be liquiable,</div>

<div class='line'>Minerall and metaline may be mercurizate,</div>
<div class='line'>Conceiue you may this science is not opinionable,</div>
<div class='line'>But very true, by Raymond and others determinate,</div>
<div class='line'>In the saide booke the Philosophers speake also,</div>
<div class='line'>Therein if it please your Highnes for to reade,</div>
<div class='line'>Of diuers sulphures, and especially of two,</div>
<div class='line'>And of two mercuries ioyned to them indeed,</div>

<div class='line'>Whereby he doth true vnderstanders leade,</div>
<div class='line'>To the knowledge of the principle which is onely trew,</div>
<div class='line'>Both red, moist, pure, and white, as I haue espied,</div>
<div class='line'>Which be neuerthelesse found but of verie few.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>And these two things be best, he addeth anone</div>
<div class='line'>For him that worketh the Alchymie to take:</div>
<div class='line'>Our golde and our siluer therewith to make all one,</div>
<div class='line'>Wherefore I say who will our pearle and Ruby make,</div>
<div class='line'>The said principles looke he not forsake:</div>
<div class='line'>For at the beginning, if his principles be true,</div>
<div class='line'>And if so be by craft he can them also bake,</div>

<div class='line'>In th'end truly his worke he shall not rue.</div>
<div class='line'>But one great secret right needfull to be knowne,</div>
<div class='line'>That though the Philosophers speake plurally,</div>
<div class='line'>All is but one thing you may me well trowe,</div>
<div class='line'>In kinde which is our base principally,</div>
<div class='line'>Whereof doth spring both white and red naturally,</div>
<div class='line'>And yet the white must come first out of the red,</div>

<div class='line'>Which thing is not wrought manually,</div>
<div class='line'>But naturally, craft helping out of our lead.</div>
<div class='line'>For all the partes of our most precious stone,</div>
<div class='line'>As I can proue, be coessentiall and concrete,</div>
<div class='line'>Moreouer there is no true principle but one,</div>
<div class='line'>Full long it was ere I therewith could meete,</div>
<div class='line'>Who can reduce him and knoweth his heate,</div>

<div class='line'>And onely kinde with kinde can well redresse,</div>
<div class='line'>Till filthie originall be clensed from his seate,</div>
<div class='line'>He likely is to finde our secrets more and lesse.</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore worke kinde onely with his owne kinde,</div>
<div class='line'>And so your Elements ioyne that they not striue▪</div>
<div class='line'>This poynt also for any beare in minde,</div>
<div class='line'>That passiue natures you turne into actiue,</div>

<div class='line'>Of water, fire, and winde of earth make bliue,</div>
<div class='line'>And of the quadrangle make a figure round,</div>
<div class='line'>Then haue thou the honie of our bee-hiue,</div>
<div class='line'>One ounce well worth one thousand pound.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>The principall secret of secrets all,</div>
<div class='line'>Is true proportion which may not be behinde,</div>
<div class='line'>Wherein I counsell thee be not superficiall,</div>
<div class='line'>The true conclusion if you thinke to finde,</div>
<div class='line'>Turne earth into water and water into winde,</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore make fire and beware of the flood</div>
<div class='line'>Of Noah, wherein many men are so blinde,</div>

<div class='line'>That by this science they get little good.</div>
<div class='line'>I counsell you eate and drink temperately,</div>
<div class='line'>And beware well that Iposarcha come not in place,</div>
<div class='line'>Neshe not your wombe by drinking immoderately,</div>
<div class='line'>Least you quench naturall heate in little space,</div>
<div class='line'>The colour will tell appearing in your face,</div>
<div class='line'>Drinke no more therefore than you may eate,</div>

<div class='line'>Walke vp and downe after an easie pace,</div>
<div class='line'>Chafe not your bodie too sore to sweate.</div>
<div class='line'>With easie fire after mouing when you sweate,</div>
<div class='line'>Warme your bodie and make it drie againe,</div>
<div class='line'>By riuers and fountaines walke after meate,</div>
<div class='line'>At morning time visit the high mountaine,</div>
<div class='line'>That Phisick so biddeth I read certaine,</div>

<div class='line'>So high the mountaines yet doe you not ascend,</div>
<div class='line'>But that you may downwardes your way haue plaine,</div>
<div class='line'>And with your mantle from colde ye you defend.</div>
<div class='line'>Such labour is wholesome your sweat for to drie</div>
<div class='line'>With napkin, and after it see you take no colde,</div>
<div class='line'>For grosse humors be purged by sweate kindely,</div>
<div class='line'>Vse Diacameron then confect with perfect golde,</div>

<div class='line'>Hermidocles for watry humors good I holde,</div>
<div class='line'>Vse Jpericon perforat with milke of tincturiall,</div>
<div class='line'>And sperma Caeti with red wine, and when you wax olde,</div>
<div class='line'>And Goats milke sod with wine nourisheth moysture radicall.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>But a good Phisition who so intendeth to be,</div>
<div class='line'>Our lower Astronomie needeth well to know,</div>
<div class='line'>And after that to learne well vrine in a glasse to see,</div>
<div class='line'>And if it neede to be chafed the fire for to blow,</div>
<div class='line'>Then wittily it by diuers wayes for to throw</div>
<div class='line'>After the cause to make a medicine bliue,</div>
<div class='line'>Truly telling the infirmities all on a row,</div>

<div class='line'>Who this can doe by his Phisick is like to thriue.</div>
<div class='line'>VVe haue our heauen incorruptible of the quintessence,</div>
<div class='line'>Ornate with signes, Elements, and starres bright,</div>
<div class='line'>VVhich moysteth our earth by subtill influence,</div>
<div class='line'>And of it a secret sulphure hid from sight,</div>
<div class='line'>It fetcheth by vertue of his actiue might,</div>
<div class='line'>Like as the Bee fetcheth honey out of the flower,</div>

<div class='line'>VVhich thing could doe no other worldly wight.</div>
<div class='line'>Therefore to God be all glory and honour.</div>
<div class='line'>And like as yee to water doth relent,</div>
<div class='line'>VVhere it was congealed by violence of colde,</div>
<div class='line'>VVhen Phoebus it shineth with his heate influent,</div>
<div class='line'>Euen so to water minerall reduced is our golde,</div>
<div class='line'>As witnesseth plainely, Albert, Raymond, and Arnold,</div>

<div class='line'>By heate and moysture and by craft occasionate,</div>
<div class='line'>VVhich congelation of the spirits, loe now J haue tolde,</div>
<div class='line'>How our materialls together must be proportionate.</div>
<div class='line'>At the dyers craft you may learne this science,</div>
<div class='line'>Beholding with water how decoction they make</div>
<div class='line'>Vpon the wad or madder easily and with patience,</div>
<div class='line'>Till tinctures doe appeare which then the cloth doth take,</div>

<div class='line'>Therein so fixed that they will neuer forsake</div>
<div class='line'>The cloth, for washing after they ioyned be,</div>
<div class='line'>Euen so our tinctures with the water of our lake,</div>
<div class='line'>VVe draw by boyling vvith the ashes of Hermes tree.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>Which tinctures when they by craft are made perfite,</div>
<div class='line'>So dyeth mettles with colours aye permanent,</div>
<div class='line'>After the qualitie of the medicine, red or white,</div>
<div class='line'>That neuer away with anie fire wilbe brent:</div>
<div class='line'>To this example if you take good tent,</div>
<div class='line'>Vnto your purpose the rather you shall winne.</div>
<div class='line'>And let your fire be easie, and not too feruent,</div>

<div class='line'>Where nature did leaue what time you did beginne.</div>
<div class='line'>First calcine, and after that putrifie,</div>
<div class='line'>Dissolue, distill, sublime, discend and fixe,</div>
<div class='line'>With Aqua vitae oft times both wash and drie,</div>
<div class='line'>And make a marriage the bodie and spirite betwixt,</div>
<div class='line'>Which thus together naturallie if you can mixe,</div>
<div class='line'>In loosing of the bodie the water congeald shalbe,</div>

<div class='line'>Then shall the bodie die vtterlie of the flixe,</div>
<div class='line'>Bleeding and changing his colours, as you shall see.</div>
<div class='line'>The third day againe to life he shall arise,</div>
<div class='line'>And deuoure birds, and beasts of the wildernesse,</div>
<div class='line'>Crowes, popingaies, pies, peacocks, and mauois,</div>
<div class='line'>The Phoenix, with the Eagle, and the Griffin of fearfulnesse,</div>
<div class='line'>The greene Lion, with the red Dragon he shall distresse,</div>

<div class='line'>With the white Dragon, and the Antelop, Vnicorne & Panther,</div>
<div class='line'>With other beasts and birds both more and lesse,</div>
<div class='line'>The Basiliske also, which almost each one doth feare.</div>
<div class='line'>Jn bus and nibus he shall arise and descend,</div>
<div class='line'>Vp to the Moone, and sith vp to the Sunne,</div>
<div class='line'>Through the Ocean sea, which round is withouten end,</div>
<div class='line'>Onely shippen within a little glassen tunne;</div>

<div class='line'>When he is there come, then is the mastrie wonne:</div>
<div class='line'>About which iourney, great goods you shall not spend,</div>
<div class='line'>And yet you shall be glad that euer it was begunne,</div>
<div class='line'>Patiently if you list to your worke attend.</div>

<hr/>

<div class='line'>For then both bodie and spirite with oyle and water,</div>
<div class='line'>Soule, and tincture, one thing both white and red,</div>
<div class='line'>After colours variable it containeth, whatsouer men clatter;</div>
<div class='line'>Which also is called after he hath once been dead</div>
<div class='line'>And is reuiued, our Markaside, our Magnet, and our lead,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Sulphur, our Arsinike, and our true Calx viue,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Sunne, our Moone, our ferment and our bread,</div>

<div class='line'>Our toad, our Basiliske▪ our vnknowen bodie, our man, our wife.</div>
<div class='line'>Our bodie thus naturally by craft when he is renouate</div>
<div class='line'>Of the first order, is medicine called in our Philosophie;</div>
<div class='line'>Which oftentimes againe must be propertualicate,</div>
<div class='line'>The round wheele turning of our Astronomie,</div>
<div class='line'>And so to the Elixer of spirits you must come: for why</div>
<div class='line'>Till the sonne of the fixed by the sonne of the fixer be ouergone,</div>

<div class='line'>Elixer of bodies, named it is onely,</div>
<div class='line'>And this found secret poynt, deceaueth manie one.</div>
<div class='line'>This naturall proces by helpe of craft thus consummate,</div>

<div class='line'>Then in Balneo Mare together let them be circulate,</div>
<div class='line'>Like new honie or oyle, till perfectly they be thickned.</div>
<div class='line'>Then will that medicine heale all infirmitie,</div>

<div class='line'>And turne all mettals to Sunne and Moone perfectly,</div>
