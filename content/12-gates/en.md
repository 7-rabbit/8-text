<h1>12 Gates</h1>

The Compound of Alchymie. A most excellent, learned, and wor∣thie worke, written to king Edward tht fourth, by Sir George Ripley, Chanon of Bridlington in York-shire, con∣tayning twelue gates. The Prologue.

CHilde of this discipline incline to me thine eare<br/>
And harkē to my doctrine with al thy diligēce<br/>
These words of wisedome in minde doe thou beare,<br/>
Which of olde fathers be true in sentence:<br/>
Liue cleane in soule, to God doe no offence.<br/>
Exalt thee not but rather keepe thee lowe,<br/>
Else will thy God in thee no wisdome sowe.

From sinfull doctrine and wicked thought,<br/>
The holy spirite doth him withdraw,<br/>
Nilling to dwell where sinne is wrought:<br/>
Dread God therefore and obey his law:<br/>
A righteous man forsooke I neuer sawe:<br/>
Neyther his seede begge bread for neede:<br/>
In holy scripture this doe I reede.

---

Make wisdome therefore thy mother to be,<br/>
And call on Prudence to be thy friend,<br/>
By pathes of truth they will guide thee,<br/>
With loue and honesty wheresoeuer thou wend:<br/>
Both vertuous to be, curteous and hend:<br/>
Pray God therefore that thou maist finde,<br/>
Wisedome and Prudence with mouth and minde.

All manner good come with them shall,<br/>
And honestie by their hands innumerable,<br/>
Then into cumbrance shalt thou not fall,<br/>
So be they in riches incomparable:<br/>
To worship and profite they will thee able,<br/>
To cunning and all manner of grace,<br/>
Both here and after thy liues space.

For these benefites which they doe bring,<br/>
I meane these vertues of prudence and sapience,<br/>
To whome I can compare nothing,<br/>
No riches, nor spices of redolence,<br/>
Aboue all treasure such is their excellence,<br/>
That whatsoeuer earthly precious is,<br/>
To them is compared as clay I wis.

Infinite treasure to man they be,<br/>
Who vseth them shall friendship haue<br/>
With God in heauen and there him see,<br/>
After them therefore busily craue,<br/>
For bodie and soule they will both saue,<br/>
And here in goods thee multiply;<br/>
And afore princes thee dignifie.

---

Thinke how Adam lost his wisedome,<br/>
Sampson his might which was so strong:<br/>
King Saule also lost his kingdome,<br/>
And Dauid was punished for his wrong:<br/>
In the Oke by the haire fayre Absolon hong,<br/>
King Ezechias by sicknes had punishment,<br/>
And many one moe for sinne was shent.

But see how other which liued weele,<br/>
And to their God did no offence,<br/>
Such chastisement did neuer feele;<br/>
But God sheweth euer to them beneuolence,<br/>
Enoch and Hely were carried hence,<br/>
To Paradice, and orher good liuers were<br/>
Of God rewarded in diuerse mannere.

Some had great Fortune, some great cunning,<br/>
Some had great peace, some great riches,<br/>
Some conquered lands to their great wynning▪<br/>
Some were exalted for their great meeknes,<br/>
Some other were saued from the cruelnes<br/>
Of Tyrants, Lyons, and of the hot furnace,<br/>
As Daniel and others in many a place.

Thus to good liuers God sent great grace,<br/>
And vnto sinners great and sore punishment,<br/>
Some to amend in this life had space,<br/>
Some sodainely with fire from heauen were brent,<br/>
Sinfull Sodomites for euer were shent,<br/>
With Dathan and Abiron with many moe,<br/>
Which sunke for sinne to endles woe.

---

Thus euer sith this world was wrought,<br/>
God hath rewarded both euill and good:<br/>
Thus if it may rest in thy thought,<br/>
From sinfull liuing to change thy moode.<br/>
If sinfull people this vnderstoode,<br/>
They ought to be afrayde God to offend,<br/>
And soone their sinfull liues to amend.

Therefore with God looke thou beginne,<br/>
That he by grace may dwell with thee,<br/>
So shalt thou best to wisdome winne;<br/>
And knowledge of our great priuitie:<br/>
Nourish vertues, and from vices flee,<br/>
And trusting thou wilt thee well dispose,<br/>
Our secrets to thee I will disclose.

Keepe thou them secreate and for me pray,<br/>
Looke that thou vse them to Gods pleasure,<br/>
Doo good with them what euer thou may;<br/>
For time thou shalt this life indure,<br/>
That after thy ende thou mayst be sure<br/>
In heauen for to rewarded be,<br/>
Which God graunt both to me and thee.

<h2>The Preface.</h2>

O High incomprehensible and glorious Maiestie,<br/>
Whose luminous beames obtundeth our specula∣tion,<br/>
O trinehood in persons ô onehood in deity, t<br/>
Of Iherarchiall Iubilists gratulant glorification,<br/>
O piteous purifier of soules and pure perpetuation,<br/>
O deuiant from danger, ô drawer most debonayre,<br/>
From this troublesome vale of vanitie, ô our Exalter.

O power, ô wisdome, ô goodnes inexplicable,<br/>
Supporte me, teach me, and be my gouernor,<br/>
That neuer my liuing to thee be displicable,<br/>
But that I acquite me to thee as true professor,<br/>
At this beginning good Lord heare my prayer,<br/>
Be nigh with grace for to inforce my will,<br/>
Graunt witt that I may mine intent fulfill.

Most curious Cofer and copious of all treasure,<br/>
Thou art he from whome all goodnes doth discend,<br/>
To man and also to euery creature,<br/>
Thine handy-work therefore vouchsafe to defend,<br/>
That we no time in liuing here mispend,<br/>
With troth here graunt vs our liuing so to winne,<br/>
That into no danger of sinfulnes we rinne.

And forasumch as we haue for thy sake<br/>
Renounced our wills, the world and fleshly lust,<br/>
As thine owne professors vs to thee take,<br/>
Sith in thee onely dependeth all our trust;<br/>
We can no further; to thee incline we must:<br/>
Thy secret treasure vouchsafe vnto vs,<br/>
Shew vs thy secrets and to vs be bounteous.

---

And amongst others which be profest to thee,<br/>
I me present as one with humble submission,<br/>
Thy seruant beseeching that I may bee,<br/>
And true in liuing according to my profession,<br/>
In order Chanon Reguler of Bridlington;<br/>
Beseeching thee Lord thou wilt me spare,<br/>
To thy true seruants thy secrets to declare.

In the beginning when thou mad'st all of nought,<br/>
A globous matter and darke vnder confusion,<br/>
By him the beginning marueilously was wrought,<br/>
Conteyning naturally all things without diuision:<br/>
Of which in six dayes he made cleere distinction:<br/>
As Genesis apertly doth record.<br/>
Then heauen and earth were perfected by his word.

So through his will and power, out of one mas<br/>
Confused; was made each thing that being is,<br/>
But afore in glory as maker he was,<br/>
Now is and shall be without end I wis,<br/>
And purified soules vp to his blis<br/>
Shall come a principle this may be one,<br/>
For the declaring of our precious stone.

For as of one masse was made all thing,<br/>
Right so in our practize must it be,<br/>
All our secreats of one Image must spring,<br/>
As in Philosophers bookes whoso list to see,<br/>
Our stone is called the lesse world, one and three;<br/>
Magnesa also of sulphure and Mercurie,<br/>
Proportionate by nature most perfectlie.

---

But many one marueileth and maruaile may,<br/>
And museth on such a marueilous thing,<br/>
What is our stone; sith Philosophers say<br/>
To such as euer be it in seeking.<br/>
For foules and fisshes to vs doth it bring,<br/>
Euery man it hath, and it is in euery place,<br/>
In thee in me, and in each thing, time and space?

To this I answere that Mercurie it is I wis,<br/>
But not the common called quicksiluer by name,<br/>
But Mercurie without which nothing being is,<br/>
All Philosophers record and truely saine the same,<br/>
But simple searchers putteth them in blame,<br/>
Saying they hid it but they be blame worthy,<br/>
Which be no Clearkes and meddle with Philosophy.

But though it Mercurie be, yet wisely vnderstand,<br/>
Wherein it is, and where thou shalt it seech,<br/>
Else I counsell thee take not this work in hand,<br/>
For Philosophers flatter fooles with fayre speech:<br/>
But listen to me, for truly I will thee teach,<br/>
Which is this Mercurie most profitable,<br/>
Being to thee nothing deceiueable.

It is more neere in some things than in some;<br/>
Therefore take heede what I to thee write<br/>
For if knowledge to thee neuer come,<br/>
Therefore yet shalt thou me not twite,<br/>
For I will truely now thee excite<br/>
To vnderstand well Mercuries three,<br/>
The keyes which of this science bee.

---

Raymond his menstrues doth them call,<br/>
Without which truly no trueth is done:<br/>
But two of them be superficiall,<br/>
The third essentiall of Sunne and Moone,<br/>
Their properties I will declare right soone,<br/>
And Mercurie of mettalls essentiall,<br/>
Is the principle of our stone materiall.

In Sunne and Moone our Menstrue is not seene,<br/>
It appeareth not but by effect to sight,<br/>
That is the stone of which we meene,<br/>
Who so our writings conceiueth aright,<br/>
It is a soule, a substance bright.<br/>
Of Sunne and Moone a subtill influence,<br/>
Whereby the earth receiueth resplendence.

For what is Sunne and Moone sayth Auicen,<br/>
But earth which is pure white and red:<br/>
Take from it the said cleerenes, and then<br/>
That earth will stand but in little stead;<br/>
The whole compound is called our lead:<br/>
The qualitie of clearenes from Sun and Moone dooth come,<br/>
These are our menstrues both all and some.

Bodies with the first we calcine naturally<br/>
Perfect, but none which been vncleene,<br/>
Except one which is vsually<br/>
Named by Philosophers the Lyon greene:<br/>
He is the meane the Sunne and Moone betweene<br/>
Of winning tincture with perfectnes,<br/>
As Geber thereunto beareth witnes.

---

With the second which is an humiditie<br/>
Vegitable, reuiuing that earst was dead,<br/>
Both principles materials must loosed be<br/>
And formalls, els stand they little in stead:<br/>
These menstrews therefore know I thee reed,<br/>
Without the which neither true calcination<br/>
Done may be, not true dissolution.

With the third humiditie most permanent,<br/>
Incombustible and vnctuous in his nature,<br/>
Hermes tree vnto ashes is brent,<br/>
It is our naturall fire most sure,<br/>
Our Mercurie, our Sulphur, our tincture pure,<br/>
Our soule, our stone borne vp with winde<br/>
In the earth ingendred, beare this in minde.

This stone also tell thee I dare,<br/>
Is the vapour of mettalls potentiall,<br/>
How thou shalt get it, thou must beware,<br/>
For inuisible truely is this menstruall,<br/>
Howbeit with the second water philosophicall,<br/>
By separation of Elements it may appeare<br/>
To sight, in forme of water cleare.

If this menstrue by labour exuberate<br/>
With it may be made Sulphur of nature,<br/>
If it be well and kindly acuate<br/>
And circulate into a spirit pure,<br/>
Then to dissolue thou must be sure,<br/>
Thy base with it in diuers wise,<br/>
As thou shalt know by thy practise.

---

That poynt therefore in his due place,<br/>
I will declare with other moe,<br/>
If God will graunt me grace and space,<br/>
And me preserue in life from woe,<br/>
As I thee teach looke thou doe so:<br/>
And for the first ground principall,<br/>
Vnderstand thy waters menstruall.

And when thou hast made Calcination,<br/>
Encreasing not wasting moysture radicall,<br/>
Vntill thy base by oft subtilation,<br/>
Will lightly flowe as wax vpon mettall,<br/>
Then loose it with thy vegetable menstruall,<br/>
Till thou haue oyle thereof in colour bright,<br/>
Then is that menstrue visible to sight.

And oyle is drawne out in colour of golde,<br/>
Or like thereto out of fine red lead,<br/>
Which Raymond sayd when he was olde,<br/>
Much more than golde would stand in stead:<br/>
For when he was for age nigh dead,<br/>
He made thereof Aurum potabile,<br/>
Which him reuiued as men might see.

For so together may they be circulate,<br/>
That is the base oyle and the vegetable menstruall,<br/>
So that it be by labour exuberate,<br/>
And made by craft a stone celestiall,<br/>
Of nature so firie that we it call,<br/>
Our Bazeliske or our Cockatrice,<br/>
Our great Elixer most of price.

---

Which as the sight of Bazeliske his obiect<br/>
Killeth, so sleyeth it crude Mercurie,<br/>
When thereupon he is proiect,<br/>
In twinckle of an eye most sodainly,<br/>
That Mercurie then teineth permanently,<br/>
All bodies to Sunne and Moone perfect,<br/>
Thus guide thy base both red and white.

Aurum potabile thus is made,<br/>
Of golde not commonly calcinate,<br/>
But of our tincture that will not fade,<br/>
Out of our base drawn with the menstrue circulate▪<br/>
But naturall calcination must algate<br/>
Be made, ere thy golde dissolued may bee,<br/>
That principle first therefore I will teach thee.

But into chapters this Treatise I will diuide,<br/>
In number twelue with due recapitulation;<br/>
Superfluous rehearsalls Ile lay aside,<br/>
Intending onely to giue true information,<br/>
Both of theorick and practick operation:<br/>
That by my writing whoso guided will bee,<br/>
Of his intent perfectly speede shall hee.

The first chapter shall be of naturall Calcination,<br/>
The second of Dissolution secreat and Philosophicall,<br/>
The third of our elementall Separation,<br/>
The fourth of Coniunction matrimoniall,<br/>
The fift of Putrifaction follow shall,<br/>
Of Congelation albificate shalbe the sixt,<br/>
Then of Cibation the seauenth shall follow next.

---

The secret of Sublimation the eight shall show;<br/>
The ninth shall be of firmentation;<br/>
The tenth of our exaltation I trow;<br/>
The eleuenth of our meruailous multiplication;<br/>
The twelfth of proiection, then recapitulation:<br/>
And so this treatize shall take an end,<br/>
By the helpe of God as I intend.

<h2>Of Calcination. The first Gate.</h2>

CAlcination is the purgation of our stone,<br/>
Restoring also of his naturall heate,<br/>
Of radicall humiditie it looseth none,<br/>
Inducing solution into our stone most meete,<br/>
After philosophie I you behight<br/>
Doo, but not after the common guise,<br/>
With Sulphures or Salts preparate in diuers wise.

Neither with Corosiues nor with fire alone,<br/>
Neither with vineger nor with water ardent,<br/>
Nor with the vapour of leade our stone<br/>
Is calcined according to our intent:<br/>
All those to calcining which so be bent,<br/>
From this hard science withdrawe their hand,<br/>
Till they our calcining better vnderstand.

---

For by such calcination their bodies be shent,<br/>
Which minisheth the moysture of our stone:<br/>
Therefore when bodies to powder be brent,<br/>
Dry as ashes of tree or bone,<br/>
Of such calxes then will we none;<br/>
For moysture we multiplie radicall,<br/>
In calcining minishing none at all.

And for a sure ground of our true calcination,<br/>
Worke wittely only kind with kind:<br/>
For kind vnto kind hath appetitiue inclination,<br/>
Who knoweth not this in knowledge is blind,<br/>
He may foorth wander as mist in the wind,<br/>
Wotting neuer with profite where to light,<br/>
Because he conceaues not our words aright.

Ioyne kind to kind therefore as reason is,<br/>
For euery burgeon answers his owne seede,<br/>
Man getteth man, a beast a beast I wis,<br/>
Further to treate of this it is no neede.<br/>
But vnderstand this poynt if thou wilt speede,<br/>
Each thing is first calcined in his owne kind;<br/>
This well conceaued fruite therein shalt thou finde.

And we make Calx vnctuous both white and red<br/>
Of three degrees or our base be perfect,<br/>
Fluxible as waxe, els stand they in no sted.<br/>
By right long processe as Philosophers doo write,<br/>
A yeare we take or more to our respite:<br/>
For in lesse space our Calxes will not be made,<br/>
Able to teyne with colour that will not fade.

---

And for thy proportion thou must beware,<br/>
For therein maist thou be beguil'd,<br/>
Therefore thy work that thou not mare,<br/>
Let thy bodie be subtilly fyl'de<br/>
With Mercury as much then so subtil'd,<br/>
One of the Sunne, two of the Moone,<br/>
Till altogether like papp be doone.

Then make the Mercurie foure to the Sun▪<br/>
Two to the Moone as it should bee,<br/>
And thus thy worke must be begun,<br/>
In figure of the Trinitee,<br/>
Three of the bodie and of the spirite three,<br/>
And for the vnitie of the substance spirituall<br/>
One moe than of the substance corporall.

By Raymonds reportory this is true,<br/>
Proportion there who list to looke,<br/>
The same my Doctor to me did shew,<br/>
But three of the spirite Bacon tooke,<br/>
To one of the bodie for which I a wooke,<br/>
Many a night ere I it wist.<br/>
And both be true take which you list.

If the water also be equall in proportion<br/>
To the earth, with heate in due measure,<br/>
Of them shall spring a new burgeon,<br/>
Both white and red in pure tincture,<br/>
Which in the fire shall euer indure,<br/>
Kill thou the quick the dead reuiue;<br/>
Make trinitie vnitie without any striue.

---

This is the surest and best proportion,<br/>
For there is least of the part spirituall,<br/>
The better therefore shall be solution,<br/>
Than if thou did it with water swall,<br/>
Thine earth ouer glutting which loseth all<br/>
Take heede therefore to potters loame,<br/>
And make thou neuer too neshe thy wombe.

That loame beholde how it tempred is,<br/>
The meane also how it is calcinate,<br/>
And euer in minde looke thou beare this;<br/>
That neuer thine earth with water be suffocate,<br/>
Drye vp thy moysture with heate most temperate,<br/>
Help Dissolution with moysture of the Moone,<br/>
And Congelation with the Sunne, then hast thou doone.

Foure Natures into the fift so shalt thou turne,<br/>
Which is a Nature most perfect and temperate,<br/>
But hard it is with thy bare foote to spurne<br/>
Against a barr of yron, or steele new acuate,<br/>
For many doe so which be infatuate,<br/>
When they such high things take in hand,<br/>
Which they in no wise doe vnderstand.

In egges, in vitriall, or in blood,<br/>
What riches wend they there to finde,<br/>
If they Philosophy vnderstood,<br/>
They would not in working be so blinde;<br/>
Golde or siluer to seeke out of kinde:<br/>
For like as fire of burning principle is,<br/>
So is the principle of gilding gould I wis.

---

If thou intend therefore for to make<br/>
Gold and Siluer by craft of our philosophie,<br/>
Thereto neyther egges nor bloud thou take<br/>
But Gold and Siluer which naturally<br/>
Calcined wisely and not manually,<br/>
A new generation will forth bring,<br/>
Encreasing their kinde as doth euery thing.

And if it true were that profit might be<br/>
In things which be not mettaline,<br/>
In which be coulors pleasant to see,<br/>
As in bloud, eggs, haire, vrine. or wine,<br/>
Or in meane mineralls digd out of the myne,<br/>
Yet must that element be putrified and seperate,<br/>
And with Elements of perfect bodies be dispousate.

But first of these elements make thou rotacion,<br/>
And into water thine earth turne first of all,<br/>
Then of thy water make ayre by leuigacion,<br/>
And ayre make fier, then Maister I will thee call<br/>
Of all our secrets great and small:<br/>
The wheele of Elements then canst thou turne about,<br/>
Truely conceiuing our writings without doubt.

This done, goe backwards turning the wheele againe,<br/>
And into water turne thy fire anone,<br/>
Ayre into earth, els labourest thou in vaine,<br/>
For so to temperment is brought our stone,<br/>
And Natures contractions foure are made one,<br/>
After they haue three times been circulate,<br/>
And also thy base perfectly consumate.

---

Thus vnder the moysture of the Moone,<br/>
And vnder the temperate heate of the Sunne,<br/>
Thine Elements shalbe incinerate soone,<br/>
And then thou hast the maistrie wonne:<br/>
Thanke God thy worke was then so begunne,<br/>
For there thou hast one token trewe,<br/>
Which first in blacknes to thee will shewe.

The head of the Crowe that token call wee,<br/>
And some men call it the Crowes bill;<br/>
Some call it the ashes of Hermes tree,<br/>
And thus they name it after their will:<br/>
Our Toade of the earth which eateth his fill,<br/>
Some nameth it by which it is mortificate<br/>
The spirit with venome intoxicate.

But it hath names I say to thee infinite,<br/>
For after each thing that blacknes is to sight,<br/>
Named it is till time it waxeth white,<br/>
Then hath it names of more delight,<br/>
After all things that been full white,<br/>
And the red likewise after the same,<br/>
Of all red things doth take the name.

At the first gate now art thou in,<br/>
Of the Philosophers Castell where they dwell,<br/>
Proceede wisely that thou may winne<br/>
In at moe gates of that Castell,<br/>
Which Castell is round as any bell,<br/>
And gates it hath eleuen yet moe,<br/>
One is conquered, now to the second goe.

The end of the first gate.

---

<h2>Of Dissolution. The second Gate.</h2>

OF Dissolution now will I speake a word or two,<br/>
Which sheweth out what erst was hid frō sight,<br/>
And maketh intenuate things that were thicke also,<br/>
By vertue of our first menstrue cleare and bright,<br/>
In which our bodies eclipsed been of light,<br/>
And of their hard and drye compaction subtilate,<br/>
Into their owne first matter kindly retrogradate.

One in gender they be, and in number two,<br/>
Whose Father is the Sunne, the Moone the Mother,<br/>
The Mouer is Mercurie, these and no moe<br/>
Be our Magnesia, our Adropp, and none other<br/>
Things here be, but onely sister and brother,<br/>
That is to meane agent and patient,<br/>
Sulphure and Mercury coessentiall to our intent.

Betwixt these two equalitie contrarious,<br/>
Ingendred is a meane most marueilously,<br/>
Which is our Mercury and menstrue vnctuous,<br/>
Our secreat Sulphure working inuisibly,<br/>
More fiercely than fire burning the bodie,<br/>
Dissoluing the bodie into water minerall,<br/>
Which night for darknes in the North we doe call.

---

But yet I trow thou vndestandst not vtterly,<br/>
The very secreat of the Philosophers Dissolution,<br/>
Therefore conceiue me I counsell thee wittily,<br/>
For the truth I will tell thee without delusion:<br/>
Our solution is cause of our Congelation;<br/>
For Dissolution on the one side corporall,<br/>
Causeth Congelation on the other side spirituall.

And we dissolue into water which wetteth no hand,<br/>
For when the earth is integrately incinerate,<br/>
Then is the water congealed; this vnderstand<br/>
For the elements be so together concatenate,<br/>
That when the bodie is from his first forme alterate,<br/>
A new forme is induced immediatly,<br/>
For nothing being without all forme is vtterly.

And heere a secret to thee I will disclose,<br/>
Which is the ground vnto our secrets all,<br/>
And it not knowne thou shalt but lose<br/>
Thy labour and costs both great and small,<br/>
Take heed therefore in error that thou not fall,<br/>
The more thine earth, and the lesse thy water be,<br/>
The rather and better solucion shalt thou see.

Behold how yce to water doth relent,<br/>
And so it must for water it was before,<br/>
Right so againe to water our earth is went,<br/>
And water thereby congeald for euermore,<br/>
For after all Philosophers that euer were bore,<br/>
Each mettall was once water mynerall,<br/>
Therefore with water they turne to water all.

---

In which water of kinde occasionate,<br/>
Of qualities been repugnant and diuersitie,<br/>
Things into things must therefore be rotate,<br/>
Vntill diuersitie be brought to perfect vnitie:<br/>
For Scripture recordeth when the earth shall be<br/>
Troubled, and into the deepe Sea shall be cast,<br/>
Mountaines and bodies likewise at the last.

Our bodies be likened conueniently<br/>
To mountaines, which after high Planets we name,<br/>
Into the deepnes therefore of Mercurie<br/>
Turne them, and keepe thee out of blame,<br/>
For then shalt thou see a noble game,<br/>
How all shall become powder as soft as silke,<br/>
So doth our rennit kindly kurd vp our milke.

Then hath the bodies their first forme lost,<br/>
And others been induced immediatly,<br/>
Then hast thou well bestowed thy cost:<br/>
Whereas others vncunning must goe by,<br/>
Not knowing the secrets of our philosohie:<br/>
Yet one poynt more I must tell thee,<br/>
How each bodie hath dimensions three.

Altitude, Latitude, and also profunditie,<br/>
By which all gates turne we must our wheele,<br/>
Knowing that thine entrance in the West shall be,<br/>
Thy passages forth to the North if thou doo weele,<br/>
And there thy lights lose their lights each deele;<br/>
For there thou must abide by ninetie nights<br/>
In darknes of purgatorie withouten lights.

---

Then take thy course vp to the East anone,<br/>
By colours passing variable in manifold wise,<br/>
And then be winter and vere nigh ouergone,<br/>
To the East therefore thine ascending deuise,<br/>
For there the Sunne with daylight doth vprise<br/>
In sommer, and there disport thee with delight,<br/>
For there thy worke shall become perfect white.

Foorth from the East into the South ascend,<br/>
And set thee downe there in the chaire of fire,<br/>
For there is haruest, that is to say an end<br/>
Of all this worke after thine owne desire,<br/>
There shineth the Sunne vp in his Hemisphere,<br/>
After the Eclipses in rednes with glorie,<br/>
As king to raigne vpon all mettals and Mercurie.

And in one glasse must be done all this thing,<br/>
Like to an Egge in shape and closed weele,<br/>
Then must thou know the measure of firing,<br/>
The which vnknowne thy worke is lost each deele:<br/>
Let neuer thy glasse be hotter than thou maist feele<br/>
And suffer still in thy bare hand to hold,<br/>
For feare of losing, as Philosophers haue told.

Yet to my doctrine furthermore attend,<br/>
Beware thy glasse thou neuer open ne meue<br/>
From the beginning till thou haue made an end;<br/>
If thou doo contrarie, thy worke may neuer cheue.<br/>
Thus in this Chapter which is but briefe,<br/>
I haue thee taught thy true solution:<br/>
Now to the third gate goe, for this is won.

The end of the second gate.

---

<h2>Of Seperation. The third gate.</h2>

SEperation doth each part from other diuide,<br/>
The subtile from the grosse, the thick frō the thinn<br/>
But Seperation manuall looke thou set a side,<br/>
For that pertaines to fooles that little good doth winn,<br/>
But in our Seperation Nature doth not blinn,<br/>
Making diuision of qualities elementall,<br/>
Into a fift degree till they be turned all.

Earth is turned into water vnder black and bloe,<br/>
And water after into ayre vnder very white,<br/>
Then Aire into fire, elements there be no moe,<br/>
Of these is made our stone of great delight,<br/>
But of this Seperation much more must we write,<br/>
And Seperation is called by Philosophers definition,<br/>
Of the saide foure elements terraptatiue dispersion.

Of this Seperation I finde a like figure,<br/>
Thus spoken by the Prophet in the Psalmodie,<br/>
God brought out of a stone a flood of water pure,<br/>
And out of the hardest rock oyle abundantly,<br/>
So out of our stone precious if thou be witty,<br/>
Oyle incombustable, and water thou shalt draw,<br/>
And there abouts at the coale thou needst not to blow.

---

Doe this with heate easie and nourishing,<br/>
First with moyst fire and after that with drie,<br/>
The flegme with patience out drawing,<br/>
And after that the other Natures wittely<br/>
Drye vp thine earth vntill it be thirsty,<br/>
By Calcination else labourest thou in vaine,<br/>
And then make it drink vp the moysture againe.

Seperation thus must thou oftetimes make,<br/>
Thy waters diuiding into partes two,<br/>
So that the subtile from the grosse thou take,<br/>
Till earth remaine beneath in colours bloe,<br/>
That earth is fixed to abide all woe,<br/>
The other parte is spirituall and flying,<br/>
But thou must turne them all into one thing.

Then oyle and water with water shall distill,<br/>
And through her helpe receiue mouing,<br/>
Keepe well these two that thou not spill<br/>
Thy worke for lack of due closing,<br/>
And make thy stopple of glasse melting,<br/>
The topp of thy vessell together with it,<br/>
Then Philosopher-like it is vp shit.

The water wherewith thou mayst reuiue the stone,<br/>
Looke thou distill before thou worke with it,<br/>
Oftentimes by it selfe alone,<br/>
And by this sight thou shalt wit,<br/>
From feculent feces when it is quit:<br/>
For some men can with Saturne it multiplie,<br/>
And other substance which we defie.

---

Distill it therefore till it be clene<br/>
And thinne like water as it should be,<br/>
As heauen in colour bright and shene,<br/>
Keping both figure and ponderositee,<br/>
Therewith did Hermes moysten his tree:<br/>
Within his glasse he made it grow vpright,<br/>
With flowers discoloured beautifull to sight.

This water is like to the venymous Tire,<br/>
Wherewith the mighty triacle is wrought,<br/>
For it is poyson most strong of Ire,<br/>
A stronger poyson cannot be thought,<br/>
At Pothecaries often therefore it is sought,<br/>
But no man by it shalbe intoxicate,<br/>
From the time it is into medicine elixerate.

For then as is the Triacle true,<br/>
It is of poyson most expulsiue,<br/>
And in his working doth marueiles shew,<br/>
Preseruing many from death to life,<br/>
But looke thou meddle it with no corosiue,<br/>
But choose it pure and quick rinning,<br/>
If thou thereby wilt haue winning.

It is a marueilous thing in kinde,<br/>
And without it can nothing be done,<br/>
Therefore Hermes called it his winde,<br/>
For it is vp flying from Sunne and Moone,<br/>
And maketh our stone flie with it soone,<br/>
Reuiuing the dead and giuing life,<br/>
To Sunne and Moone, husband and wife.

---

Which if they were not by craft made quick,<br/>
And their fatnes with water drawne out,<br/>
And so the thinne disseuered from the thick,<br/>
Thou shouldst neuer bring this worke about:<br/>
If thou wilt therefore speede without doubt,<br/>
Rayse vp the birds out of their neast,<br/>
And after againe bring them to rest.

Water with water accord will and ascend,<br/>
And spirit with spirit, for they be of one kinde,<br/>
Which after they be exalted make to discend,<br/>
So shalt thou deuide that, which Nature erst did binde,<br/>
Mercury essentiall turning into winde,<br/>
Without which naturall and subtill Seperation,<br/>
May neuer be complete profitable generation.

Now to helpe thee in at this gate,<br/>
The last secreat I will declare to thee,<br/>
Thy water must be seauen times sublimate,<br/>
Else shall no kindly Dissolution bee,<br/>
Nor putrifying shalt thou none see;<br/>
Like liquid pitch, nor colours appearing<br/>
For lack of fire within the glasse working.

Foure fires there be which thou must vnderstand,<br/>
Naturall, innaturall, against Nature also,<br/>
And elementall which doth burne the brand:<br/>
These foure fires vse we and no moe,<br/>
Fire against nature must doe thy bodie woe,<br/>
This is our Dragon as I thee tell,<br/>
Fiercely burning as the fire of hell.

---

Fire of nature is the third menstruall,<br/>
That fire is naturall in each thing;<br/>
But fire occasionate, we call vnnaturall,<br/>
As heate of ashes, and balnes for putrifying:<br/>
Without these fires thou maist naught bring<br/>
To Putrifaction, for to be seperate,<br/>
Thy matters together proportionate.

Therefore make fire thy glasse within,<br/>
Which burneth the bodie much more than fire<br/>
Elementall, if thou wilt winne<br/>
Our secrets according to thy desire:<br/>
Then shall thy seeds both rot and spire<br/>
By helpe of fire occasionate,<br/>
That kindly after they may be seperate.

Of Seperation the Gate must thus be wonne,<br/>
That furthermore yet thou maist proceed<br/>
Towards the Gate of secret Coniunction,<br/>
Into the Castle which will thee inner leed:<br/>
Doe after my counsell if thou wilt speed,<br/>
With two strong lockes this Gate is shir,<br/>
As consequently thou shalt well wit.

The end of the third Gate.

---

<h2>Of Coniunction. The fourth Gate.</h2>

AFter the Chapiter of naturall Seperation,<br/>
By which the elemēts of our stone disseuered be,<br/>
The chapter here followeth of secret Coniunction,<br/>
Which Natures repugnant ioyneth to perfect vnitie,<br/>
And so them knitteth that none from others may flie,<br/>
When they by fire shalbe examinate,<br/>
They be togethers so surely coniungate.

And therefore Philosophers giue this definition<br/>
Saying this Coniunction is nothing els<br/>
But of disseuered qualities a copulation,<br/>
Or of principles a coequation as others tells:<br/>
But some men with Mercurie that Pothecaries sells<br/>
Medleth bodies, which cannot diuide<br/>
Their matter, and therefore they slip aside.

For vntill the time the soule be seperate<br/>
And cleansed from his originall sinne<br/>
With the water, and throughly spiritualizate,<br/>
The true Coniunction maist thou neuer begin:<br/>
Therefore the soule first from the bodie twyne,<br/>
Then of the corporall part and of the spirituall.<br/>
The soule shall cause coniunction perpetuall.

---

Of two Coniunctions Philosophers mencion make,<br/>
Grosse when the bodie with Mercury is reincrudate▪<br/>
But let this passe, and to the second heede take,<br/>
Which as I saide is after Seperation celebrate,<br/>
In which the parties be left with least to colligate,<br/>
And so promoted vnto most perfect temperance,<br/>
That neuer after amongst them may be repugnance.

Thus causeth Seperation true Coniunction to be had,<br/>
Of water and ayre, with earth and fire,<br/>
But that each element into other may be lad,<br/>
And so abide for euer to thy desire,<br/>
Doe as doe dawbers with clay or myre,<br/>
Temper them thick and make them not too thinne,<br/>
So doe vpdrying, thou shalt the rather winne.

But manners there be of our Coniunction three,<br/>
The first is called by Philosophers Diptatiue,<br/>
The which betwixt the agent and patient must be,<br/>
Male and female, Mercury, and Sulphure viue,<br/>
Matter, and forme, thinne, and thick to thrine,<br/>
This lesson will helpe thee without any doubt,<br/>
And our Coniunction truly to bring about.

The second manner is called Triptatiue,<br/>
Which is Coniunction, made of things three,<br/>
Of bodie, soule and spirit, that they not striue,<br/>
Which trinitie thou must bring to vnitee,<br/>
For as the soule to the spirite the bond must bee;<br/>
Right so the bodie the soule to him must knit,<br/>
Out of thy minde let not this lesson flit.

---

The third manner and also the last of all,<br/>
Foure Elements together which ioyne to abide,<br/>
Tetraptatiue certainely Philosophers doe it call,<br/>
And specially Guido de Montano whose fame goeth wide,<br/>
And therefore in most laudable maner this tide,<br/>
In our Coniunction foure Elements must aggregate<br/>
In due proportion, which first a sunder were seperate.

Therefore like as the woman hath veines fifteene,<br/>
And the man but fiue to the act of their secunditie,<br/>
Required in our Coniunction first I meene,<br/>
So must the man our Sunne haue of his water three,<br/>
And nine his wife, which three to him must bee:<br/>
Then like with like will ioy haue for to dwell,<br/>
More of Coniunction me needeth not to tell.

This chapiter I will conclude right soone therefore,<br/>
Grosse Coniunction charging thee to make but one,<br/>
For seldome haue strumpets children of them ybore,<br/>
And so thou shalt neuer come by our stone,<br/>
Without thou let the woman lig alone,<br/>
That after she once haue conceiued of the man,<br/>
Her Matrix be shut vp from all other than.

For such as adde euer more crude to crude,<br/>
Opening their vessell letting their matters keele,<br/>
The sparme conceiued they nourish not but delude<br/>
Themselues, and sp•ll their worke each deele,<br/>
If thou therefore haue lift to doe weele,<br/>
Close vp thy Matrix and nourish the seede,<br/>
With heat continual and temperate if thou wilt speed.

---

And when thy vessell hath stood by moneths fiue,<br/>
And clowdes and Eclipses be passed each one,<br/>
The light appearing, encrease thy heate then beliue,<br/>
Vntill bright and shining in whitenes be thy Stone▪<br/>
Then maist thou open thy glasse anone,<br/>
And feede thy childe which is ybore,<br/>
With milke and meate ay more and more.

For now both moist and drie is so contemperate,<br/>
That of the water earth hath receiued impression,<br/>
Which neuer (after that) asunder may be seperate;<br/>
And right so water to earth hath giuen ingression,<br/>
That both together to dwell haue made profession,<br/>
And water of earth hath purchased a retentiue,<br/>
They foure made one neuer more to striue.

Thus in two things all our intent doth hing,<br/>
In drie and moist, which be contraries two▪<br/>
In drie, that it the moyst to flixing bring,<br/>
In moist, that it giue liquefaction to the earth also:<br/>
Then of them thus a temperment may foorth goe,<br/>
A temperment not so thicke as the bodie is,<br/>
Neither so thinne as water withouten mis.

Loosing and knitting thereof be principles two<br/>
Of this hard science, and poles most principall;<br/>
Howbeit that other principles be many moe,<br/>
As shining fanes, which show I shall:<br/>
Proceede therefore vnto another wall<br/>
Of this strong Castle of our wisdome,<br/>
That in at the fift Gate thou maist come.

The end of the fourth Gate.

---

<h2>Of Putrifaction. The fift Gate.</h2>

NOw we begin the chapter of Putrifaction,<br/>
Without which pole no seed may multiply,<br/>
Which must be done only by continual action<br/>
Of heate in the bodie, moyst not manually:<br/>
For bodies els may not be altred naturally,<br/>
Sith Christ doth witnes, without the graine of wheate<br/>
Dye in the ground, encrease maist thou none get.

And in likewise without the matter putrifie,<br/>
It may in no wise truly be alterate,<br/>
Neither thy Elements may be diuided kindly,<br/>
Nor the coniunction of them perfectly celebrate:<br/>
That thy labor therefore be not frustrate,<br/>
The priuitie of our putrifying well vnderstand,<br/>
Or euer thou take this worke in hand.

And Putrifaction may thus defined bee<br/>
After Philosophers sayings, to be of bodies the sleying;<br/>
And in our Compound a diuision of things three,<br/>
The killed bodies into corruption foorth leading,<br/>
And after vnto regeneration them abling,<br/>
For things being in the earth, without doubt<br/>
Be engendred of rotation of the heauens about.

---

And therefore like as I haue sayd before,<br/>
Thine Elements commixt and wisely coequate,<br/>
Thou keepe in temperate heate eschewing euermore,<br/>
That they by violent heat be not incinerate<br/>
To powder drye vnprofitably Rubificate,<br/>
But into powder black as a crowes bill,<br/>
With heate of Balne or else of our dunghill.

Vntill the time that nights be passed ninetie,<br/>
In moyst heate keepe them for any thing.<br/>
Soone after by blacknes thou shalt espie<br/>
That they draw fast to putrifying,<br/>
Which thou shalt after many colours bring<br/>
To perfect whitenes by patience easily,<br/>
And so thy seede in his nature shall multiplie.

Make each the other then to halfe and kisse,<br/>
And like as children to play them vp and downe▪<br/>
And when their shirts are filed with pisse,<br/>
Then let the woman to wash be bowne,<br/>
Which oft for faintnes will fall in a swowne,<br/>
And dye at the last with her children all,<br/>
And goe to purgatorie to purge their filth originall.

When they be there, by little and little increase<br/>
Their paines, by heat, aye more and more,<br/>
The fire from them let neuer cease.<br/>
And so that thy furnace be surely apt therefore,<br/>
Which wise men call an Athenore,<br/>
Conseruing heat required most temperatelie,<br/>
By which thy matter doth kindly putrifie.

---

Of this principle speaketh sapient Guido,<br/>
And sayth by rotting dyeth the compound corporall,<br/>
And then after Morien and other moe,<br/>
Vpriseth againe regenerate simple and spirituall,<br/>
And were not heate and moysture continuall,<br/>
Sparme in the wombe might haue none abiding,<br/>
And so there should no fruite thereof vpspring.

Therefore at the beginning our stone thou take,<br/>
And burie each one in other within their graue,<br/>
Then equally betwixt them a marriage make,<br/>
To ligge together sixe weekes let them haue,<br/>
Their seede conceiued, kindly to nourish and saue,<br/>
From the ground of their graue not rising that while,<br/>
Which secreat point doth many a one beguile.

This time of conception with easie heate abide,<br/>
The blacknes shewing shall tell thee when they dye,<br/>
For they togeather like liquid pitch that tide,<br/>
Shall swell and burble, settle and putrifie,<br/>
Shining colours therin thou shalt espie,<br/>
Like to the rainebow marueilous to sight,<br/>
The Water then beginneth to drye vpright.

For in moyst bodies heate working temperate,<br/>
Ingendreth blacknes, first of all which is,<br/>
Of kindly Coniunction the token assignate,<br/>
And of true putrifying: remember this,<br/>
For then perfectly to alter thou canst not misse,<br/>
And thus by the gate of blacknes thou must come in,<br/>
The light of Paradice in whitenes if thou wilt win.

---

For first the Sunne in his vprising obscurate<br/>
Shalbe, and passe the waters of Noes flood,<br/>
On earth which was an hundreth dayes continuate<br/>
And fiftie, away ere all these waters yood;<br/>
Right so our waters (as wisemen vnderstood)<br/>
Shall passe, that thou with Dauid may say,<br/>
Abierunt in sicco flumina: beare this away.

Soone after that Noah planted his vineyard,<br/>
Which royally flourished, and brought foorth grapes anone,<br/>
After which space thou shalt not be afeard,<br/>
For in likewise shal follow the flourishing of our stone:<br/>
And soone after that xxx. dayes be gone,<br/>
Thou shalt haue grapes right as Rubie read,<br/>
Which is our Adropp, our Vcifer, and our red lead.

For like as soules after paines transitorie<br/>
Be brought to Paradice, where euer is ioyfull life;<br/>
So shall our Stone (after his darknes in Purgatorie)<br/>
Be purged, and ioyned in Elements withouten strife,<br/>
Reioyce the whitenes and beautie of his wife,<br/>
And passe from darknes of purgatorie to light<br/>
Of Paradice, in whitenes Elixer of great might.

And that thou maist the rather to Putrifaction win,<br/>
This example thou take to thee for a true conclusion,<br/>
For all the secret of Putrifaction resteth therein;<br/>
The hart of oke that hath of water continuall infusion<br/>
Will not soone putrifie, I tell thee without delusion:<br/>
For though it in water lay 100. yeares and more.<br/>
Yet shouldst thou finde it sound as ere it was before.

---

But and thou keepe it sometime wet & sometime drie,<br/>
As thou maist see in timber by vsuall experiment,<br/>
By processe of time that oke shall putrifie;<br/>
And so euen likewise according to our intent,<br/>
Sometime our tree must with the Sunne be brent,<br/>
And then with water we must it keele,<br/>
That by this meanes to rotting we may bring it weele.

For now in wet, and now againe in drie,<br/>
And now in heate, and now againe in colde<br/>
To be, shall cause it soone to putrifie,<br/>
And so shalt thou bring to rotting thy golde:<br/>
Intreate thy bodies as I haue thee tolde,<br/>
And in thy putrifying, with heate be not too swift,<br/>
Least in the ashes thou seeke after thy thrift.

Therefore thy water out of the earth thou drawe,<br/>
And make the soule therewith for to ascend;<br/>
Then downe againe into the earth it throwe,<br/>
That they oft times so ascend and descend:<br/>
From violent heate and sudden colde defend<br/>
Thy glasse, and make thy fire so temperate,<br/>
That by the sides the matter be not vitrificate.

And be thou wise in choosing of the matter,<br/>
Meddle with no salts, sulphurs, nor meane mineralls:<br/>
For whatsoeuer any worker to thee doth clatter,<br/>
Our Sulphur and our Mercury been onely in metttalls,<br/>
Which oyles and waters some men them calls,<br/>
Foules and birds, with other names many one,<br/>
Because that fooles should neuer know our stone.

---

For of this world our stone is called the sement<br/>
Which moued by craft as nature doth require,<br/>
In his encrease shall be full opulent,<br/>
And multiply his kinde after thine owne desire,<br/>
Therefore if God vouchsafe thee to inspire,<br/>
To know the truth, and fansies to eschew<br/>
Like vnto thee in riches shall be but few.

But many men be moou'd to worke after their fantasie,<br/>
In many subiects in which be tinctures gay:<br/>
Both white and red diuided manually<br/>
To sight, but in the fire they flyeaway:<br/>
Such breake pottes and glasses day by day,<br/>
Enpoysoning themselues and loosing their sights,<br/>
With odours, smoakes, and watching vp by nights.

Their clothes be baudy and worne thread bare,<br/>
Men may them smell for multipliers where they goe,<br/>
To file their fingers with corosiues they doo not spare,<br/>
Their eyes be bleard, their cheekes leane and blowe,<br/>
And thus for had I wist they suffer losse and woe:<br/>
And such when they haue lost that was in their purse,<br/>
Then doo they chide, and Philosophers sore doo curse.

To see their houses it is a noble sport,<br/>
What furnaces, what glasses there be of diuers shapes,<br/>
What salts, what powders, what oyles, waters fort,<br/>
How eloquently de Materia prima their tungs do clap,<br/>
And yet to finde the truthe they haue no hap;<br/>
Of our Mercurie they meddle & of our sulphure viue,<br/>
Wherein they dote, and more and more vnthriue.

---

For all the while they haue Philosophers bene,<br/>
Yet could they neuer know what was our Stone,<br/>
Some sought it in dung, in vrine, some in wine,<br/>
Some in starre slyme (for thing it is but one),<br/>
In blood, in egges: some till their thrift was gone,<br/>
Diuiding Elements, and breaking manie a pot,<br/>
Sheards multiplying, but yet they hit it not.

They talke of the red man and of his white wife,<br/>
That is a speciall thing, and of the Elixers two,<br/>
Of the Quintessence, and of the Elixer of life,<br/>
Of honie, Celidonie, and of Secondines also,<br/>
These they diuide into Elements, with others moe;<br/>
No multipliers, but Philosophers called will they bee,<br/>
Which naturall Philosophie did neuer read nor see.

This fellowship knoweth our Stone right weele,<br/>
They thinke them richer than is the King,<br/>
They will him help, he shall not faile<br/>
Fraunce for to winne a wondrous thing,<br/>
The holy Crosse home will they bring,<br/>
And if the King were prisoner ytake,<br/>
Right soone his raunsome would they make.

A meruaile it is that Westminster Kerke,<br/>
To the which these Philosophers doo much haunt,<br/>
Since they can so much riches werke<br/>
As they make boast of and auaunt,<br/>
Drinking daylie at the wine a due taunt,<br/>
Is not made vp perfectly at once;<br/>
For truly it lacketh yet many stones.

---

Fooles doo follow them at the taile,<br/>
Promoted to riches weening to bee;<br/>
But will you heare, what worship and auaile<br/>
They winne in London that noble Citie?<br/>
With siluer maces (as you may see)<br/>
Sergeants awaiteth on them each bowre,<br/>
So been they men of great honour.

Sergeants seeke them from streete to streete,<br/>
Merchants and Goldsmiths lay after them watch,<br/>
That well is him that with them may meete,<br/>
For the great aduantage that they doe catch,<br/>
They hunt about as doth a bratch,<br/>
Weening to winne so great treasure,<br/>
That euer in riches they shall endure.

Some would catch their goods againe,<br/>
And some more good would aduenture,<br/>
Some for to haue would be full faine<br/>
Of ten pounds one, I you ensure,<br/>
Some which haue lent without measure<br/>
Their goods, and be with pouertie clad,<br/>
To catch a noble, would be full glad.

But when the Sergeants doth them arrest,<br/>
Their pautners be stuffed with Paris balls,<br/>
Or with signets of Saint Martins at the least;<br/>
But as for money it is pist against the walls:<br/>
Then be they led (as well for them befalls)<br/>
To Newgate or Ludgate as I you tell,<br/>
Because they shall in safegard dwell.

---

Where is my money become, saith one?<br/>
And where is mine, saith he and he?<br/>
But will you heare how subtill they be anone<br/>
In answering, that they excused be?<br/>
Saying, of our Elixers robbed be we,<br/>
Else might we haue paid you all your golde,<br/>
Though it had been more by tenne folde.

And then their Creditors they flatter so,<br/>
Promising to worke for them againe<br/>
In right short space the Elixers two,<br/>
Doting the Merchants that they be faine<br/>
To let them goe, but euer in vaine;<br/>
They worke so long, till at the last,<br/>
They be againe in prison cast.

If any them aske, why they be not ritch?<br/>
They say they can make fine golde of tinne,<br/>
But he (say they) may surely swimme the ditch,<br/>
Which is vpholden by the chinne;<br/>
We haue no stock, therefore may we not winne,<br/>
Which if we had, we would soone werck<br/>
Inough to finish vp Westminster Kerck.

And some of them be so deuout,<br/>
They will not dwell out of that place;<br/>
For there they may withouten doubt<br/>
Doe what them list to their solace,<br/>
The Archdeacon is so full of grace,<br/>
That if they blesse him with their crosse,<br/>
He forceth little of other mens losse.

---

And when they there sit at the wine,<br/>
These Monkes they say haue manie a pound,<br/>
Would God (saith one) that some were mine.<br/>
Yet care away, let the cup goe round;<br/>
Drinke on saith another, the meane is found,<br/>
I am a maister of that Arte,<br/>
I warrant vs we shall haue part.

Such causeth Monkes euill to doone,<br/>
To waste their wages through their dotage,<br/>
Some bringeth a mazer, and some a spoone,<br/>
Their Philosophers giueth them such comage,<br/>
Behighting them winning with domage,<br/>
A pound for a penie at the least againe;<br/>
And so faire promises make fooles faine.

A royall medicine one vpon twelue,<br/>
They promise them thereof to haue,<br/>
Which they could neuer for them-selue<br/>
Yet bring about, so God me saue:<br/>
Beware such Philosophers no man depraue,<br/>
Which helpe these Monkes to riches so,<br/>
In thread bare coates that they must goe.

The Abbot ought well to cherish this companie,<br/>
For they can teach his Monkes to liue in pouertie,<br/>
And to goe cloathed and moneyed religiouslie,<br/>
As did Saint Bennet, eschuing superfluitie,<br/>
Easing them also of the ponderositie<br/>
Of their purses, with pounds so aggrauate,<br/>
Which by Philosophie be now alleuiate.

---

Lo who so medleth with this rich companie,<br/>
Great boast of their winning they may make:<br/>
For they shall reape as much by their Philosophie,<br/>
As they of the taile of an ape, can take:<br/>
Beware therefore for Iesus sake,<br/>
And meddle with nothing of great cost,<br/>
For if thou doe, it is but lost.

These Philosophers (of which I spake before)<br/>
Meddle and blunder with manie a thing,<br/>
Running in errours euer more and more,<br/>
For lacke of true vnderstanding:<br/>
But like must like alwaies forth bring,<br/>
So hath God ordained in euerie kinde;<br/>
Would Iesus they would beare this in minde.

Weene they of a Nettle to haue a Rose,<br/>
Or of an Elder to haue an apple sweete:<br/>
Alas, that wisemen their goods should lose,<br/>
Trusting such lorrells when they them meete,<br/>
Which say our Stone is troden vnder feete,<br/>
And maketh them vile things to distill,<br/>
Till all their howses with stench they fill.

Some of them neuer learned a word in Schooles,<br/>
Should such by reason vnderstand Philosophie?<br/>
Be they Philosophers? Nay, they be fooles:<br/>
For their workes proue them vnwittie,<br/>
Meddle not with them, if thou be happie;<br/>
Least with their flatterie they so thee till,<br/>
That thou agree vnto their will.

---

Spend not thy money away in waste,<br/>
Giue not to euery spirit credence,<br/>
But first examine, groape, and taste;<br/>
And as thou proouest, so put thy confidence,<br/>
But euer beware of great expence:<br/>
And if the Philosopher doe liue vertuouslie,<br/>
The better thou maist trust his Philosophie.

Prooue him first, and him appose<br/>
Of all the secrets of our Stone;<br/>
Which if he knowe not, thou need not to lose,<br/>
Meddle thou no further, but let him gone,<br/>
Make he neuer so piteous a mone;<br/>
For then the Fox can fagge and faine,<br/>
When he would to his pray attaine.

If he can answere as a Clarke,<br/>
Howbeit he hath not prooued it indeed,<br/>
And thou then help him to his warke;<br/>
If he be vertuous I hold it meed,<br/>
For he will thee quite if euer he speed,<br/>
And thou shalt knowe by a little anone,<br/>
If he haue knowledge of our Stone.

One thing, one glasse, one furnace, and no moe,<br/>
Behold this principle if he doe take,<br/>
And if he doe not, then let him goe,<br/>
For he shall neuer thee rich man make;<br/>
Timely it is better thou him forsake,<br/>
Than after with losse and variance,<br/>
And other manner of displeasance.

---

But if God fortune thee to haue<br/>
This Science by doctrine which I haue told,<br/>
Discouer it not whosoeuer it craue,<br/>
For fauour, feare, siluer, or gold;<br/>
Be no oppressor, letcher nor boaster bold:<br/>
Serue thy God, and help the poore among,<br/>
If thou this life lift to continue long.

Vnto thy selfe thy secrets euer keepe<br/>
From sinners, which haue not God in dread,<br/>
But will thee cast in prison deepe,<br/>
Till thou them teach to doe it indeed,<br/>
Then slaunder on thee shall spring and spread,<br/>
That thou doest coyne then will they say,<br/>
And so vndoe thee for euer and aye.

And if thou teach them this cunning,<br/>
Their sinfull liuing for to maintaine,<br/>
In hell therefore shalbe thy woonning,<br/>
For God of thee and them will take disdaine:<br/>
As thou nought couldst therefore thee faine,<br/>
That bodie and soule thou maist both saue,<br/>
And here in peace thy liuing to haue.

Now in this Chapter I haue thee taught,<br/>
How thou thy bodies must putrifie,<br/>
And so to guide thee that thou be not caught,<br/>
And put to durance losse or villanie<br/>
My doctrine therefore remember wittely,<br/>
And passe forth towards the sixt Gate,<br/>
For thus the fift is triumphate.

The end of the fift Gate.

<h2>Of Congelation. The sixt Gate.</h2>

OF Congelation I need not much to write:<br/>
But what it is, I will to thee declare;<br/>
It is of soft things induration of colour white,<br/>
And confixation of spirits which flying are;<br/>
How to congeale, he needeth not much to care,<br/>
For Elements will knit together soone,<br/>
So that Putrifaction be kindly doone.

But Congelations be made in diuers wise,<br/>
Of spirits and bodies dissolued to water cleare,<br/>
Of salts also dissolued twice or thrise,<br/>
And then congeald into a fluxible matter;<br/>
Of such congealing, fooles fast doo clatter,<br/>
And some dissolueth diuiding manuallie<br/>
Elements them after congealing to powder drie.

But such congealing is not to our desire,<br/>
For vnto ours it is contrarious,<br/>
Our congelation dreadeth not the fire:<br/>
For it must euer stand in it vnctuous,<br/>
And it is also a tincture so bounteous,<br/>
Which in the aire congealed will not relent<br/>
To water, for then our worke were shent.

---

Moreouer congeale not into so hard a stone<br/>
As glasse or christall, which melteth by fusion,<br/>
But so that it like waxe will melt anone<br/>
Withouten blast: and beware of delusion,<br/>
For such congealing accordeth not to our conclusion<br/>
As will not flowe, but runne to water againe<br/>
Like salt congealed, then labourest thou in vaine.

Which congelation auaileth vs not a deale,<br/>
It longeth to multipliers, congealing vulgarly:<br/>
If thou therefore list to doe weele<br/>
(Sith the medicine shall neuer flowe kindly,<br/>
Neither congeale, without thou first it putrifie)<br/>
First purge, and then fixe the elements of our stone,<br/>
Till they together congeale and flowe anone.

For when thy matter is made perfectly white,<br/>
Then will the spirit with the bodie congealed be:<br/>
But of that time thou maist haue long respite<br/>
Or it congeale like pearles in sight to thee,<br/>
Such congel••••n be thou glad to see,<br/>
And after lik• graines red as blood,<br/>
Richer than any worldly good.

The earthly grosenes therefore first mortified,<br/>
In moysture blacknes ingendred is;<br/>
This principle may not be denied,<br/>
For naturall Philosophers so sayne ywis:<br/>
Which had, of whitenes thou maist not mis;<br/>
And into whitenes if thou congeale it once,<br/>
Then hast thou a stone most precious of all stones.

---

And by the drie like as the moist did putrifie,<br/>
Which caused in colour blacknes to appeare,<br/>
Right so the moyst congealed by the drie,<br/>
Ingendreth whitenes shining by night full cleare,<br/>
And drines proceedeth as whiteth the matter,<br/>
Like as in blacknes moysture doth him shew<br/>
By colours variant alwayes new and new.

The cause of all this is heate most temperate,<br/>
Working and mouing the matter continually,<br/>
And thereby also the matter is alterate,<br/>
Both inward and outward substantially,<br/>
Not as doo fooles to sight sophistically:<br/>
But in euerie part all fire to endure,<br/>
Fluxible, fixt, and stable in tincture.

As Phisicke determineth of each digestion,<br/>
First done in the stomach in which is drines,<br/>
Causing whitenes without question,<br/>
Like as the second digestion causeth rednes,<br/>
Complete in the liuer by heate in temperatenes,<br/>
Right so our Stone by drines and by heate<br/>
Digested is to white and red compleate.

But here thou must another secret knowe,<br/>
How the Philosophers childe in the ayre is borne,<br/>
Busie thee not too fast at the coale to blowe,<br/>
And take this neither for mocke nor scorne,<br/>
But trust me truly, else is all thy worke forlorne,<br/>
Without thine earth with water reuiued bee,<br/>
Our true congealing shalt thou neuer see.

---

A soule it is betwixt heauen and earth being,<br/>
Arising from the earth as ayre with water pure,<br/>
And causing life in euerie liuely thing,<br/>
Incessable running vpon our foure folde nature,<br/>
Enforcing to better him with all his cure,<br/>
Which ayre is the fire of our Philosophie,<br/>
Named now oyle, now water mysticallie.

And this meane ayre which oyle or water we call,<br/>
Our fire, our oyntment, our spirit, and our Stone,<br/>
In which one thing we ground our wisedomes all,<br/>
Goeth neither in nor out alone,<br/>
Nor the fire but the water anone:<br/>
First it out leadeth, and after it bringeth it in,<br/>
As water with water which will not lightly twin.

And so may water only our water meeue,<br/>
Which mouing causeth both death and life<br/>
And water to water doth kindly cleeue<br/>
Without repugnance or anie strife,<br/>
Which water to fooles is nothing rife,<br/>
Being of the kinde withouten doubt<br/>
Of the spirit, called water and leader out.

And water is the secret and life of euery thing,<br/>
That is of substance in this world yfound,<br/>
For of water each thing hath his beginning,<br/>
As showeth in women when they shalbe vnbound<br/>
By water, which passeth before if all be sound,<br/>
Called Albien, first from them running,<br/>
With greeuous throwes before their childing.

---

And truly that is the cause most principall<br/>
Why Philosophers charge vs to be patient,<br/>
Till time the water be dried to powder all<br/>
With nourishing heate, continuall, not violent:<br/>
For qualities be contrarious of euerie element,<br/>
Till after blacke in white be made an vnion<br/>
Of them for euer, congeald without diuision.

And furthermore, the preparation of this conuersion:<br/>
From thing to thing, from one state to another,<br/>
Is done onely by kindly and discreete operation<br/>
Of Nature, as is of sperme within the mother;<br/>
For sperme and heate, are as sister and brother,<br/>
Which be conuerted in themselues as nature can,<br/>
By action and passion at last to perfect man:

For as the bodily part by nature was combyn•te<br/>
Into man, is such as the beginner was▪<br/>
Which though it thus frō thing to thing was alterate<br/>
Not out of kinde, to mixe with other kinde did passe,<br/>
And so our matter spermaticall within our glasse,<br/>
Within it selfe must turne from thing to thing▪<br/>
By heate most temperate only it nourishing.

An other example naturall I may thee tell,<br/>
How the substance of an egge by nature is wrought<br/>
Into a Chicken not passing out of the shell,<br/>
A plainer example could I not haue thought,<br/>
And their conuersions be made till forth be brought<br/>
From state to state, the like by like in kinde,<br/>
With nourishing heate: onely beare this in minde.

---

Another example here also thou maist read<br/>
Of vegetable things, taking consideration,<br/>
How euerie thing groweth of his owne seede<br/>
Through heate and moysture, by naturall operation;<br/>
And therfore myneralls be nourished by ministration<br/>
Of moysture radicall, which there beginning was,<br/>
Not passing their kinde within one glas.

There we them turne from thing to thing againe,<br/>
Into their mother the water when they goe:<br/>
Which principle vnknowen, thou labourest in vaine.<br/>
Then all is sperme; and things there be no moe<br/>
But kinde with kinde in number two,<br/>
Male and female, agent and patient,<br/>
Within the matrix of the earth most orient.

And these be turned by heate from thing to thing<br/>
Within one glasse, and so from state to state,<br/>
Vntill the time that nature doth them bring<br/>
Into one substance of the water regenerate:<br/>
And so the sperme with his kinde is alterate,<br/>
Able in likenes his kinde to multiply,<br/>
As doth in kinde all other things naturally.

In the time of this said proces naturall,<br/>
While that the sperme conceiued is growing,<br/>
The substance is nourished with his owne menstruall,<br/>
Which water only out of the earth did spring,<br/>
Whose colour is greene in the first showing:<br/>
And from that time the Sunne hid•th his light,<br/>
Taking his course throughout the North by night.

---

The sayd menstruall is (I say to thee in counsell)<br/>
The blood of our greene Lyon and not of vitriall▪<br/>
Dame Venus can the troth of this thee tell,<br/>
At the beginning, to counsell if thou her call,<br/>
This secret is hid by Philosophers great and small,<br/>
Which blood drawne out of the greene Lyon,<br/>
For lack of heate had not perfect digestion.

But this blood called our secreat menstruall,<br/>
Wherewith our sperme is nourished temperately,<br/>
When it is turned into the feces corporall,<br/>
And so become white perfectly and very drye,<br/>
Congeald and fixed into his owne bodie,<br/>
Then biscoct blood to sight it may well seeme,<br/>
Of this worke named the milke white Dyademe.

Vnderstand now that our firie water thus acuate,<br/>
Is called our menstruall water, wherein<br/>
Our earth is loosed and naturally calcinate,<br/>
By Congelation that they may neuer twinne,<br/>
But yet to congeale more water thou may not linne:<br/>
Into three partes of the acuate water sayd afore,<br/>
With the fourth parte of the earth congealed and no more.

Vnto that substance therefore so congelate,<br/>
The fourth parte put of water christaline,<br/>
And make them then together to be dispousate,<br/>
By Congelation into a miner metaline,<br/>
Which like a sworde new slipped will shine,<br/>
After the blacknes which first will shew,<br/>
The fourth parte then giue it of water new.

---

Imbibitions many it must haue yet,<br/>
Giue it the second, and after the third also.<br/>
The sayd proportion keeping in thy witt,<br/>
Then to another the fourth time looke thou goe,<br/>
The fift time and the sixt passe not therefore,<br/>
But put two partes at each time of them three,<br/>
And at the seuenth time fiue partes must there bee.

When thou hast made seauen times Imbibition,<br/>
Againe then must thou turne about thy wheele,<br/>
And putrifie all that matter without addition,<br/>
First blacknes abiding if thou wilt doe weele,<br/>
Then into whitenes congeale it vp each deele,<br/>
And after by rednes into the south ascend,<br/>
Then hast thou brought thy base vnto an end.

Thus is thy water then diuided into partes two,<br/>
With the first parte the bodies be putrificate,<br/>
And to thine Imbibitions the second parte must goe,<br/>
With which thy matter is afterwarde demigrate,<br/>
And soone vpon easie decoction albificate,<br/>
Then is it named by Philosophers out starry stone,<br/>
Bring that to rednes then is the sixt gate wonne.

The end of the sixt gate.

<h2>Of Cibation. The seuenth Gate.</h2>

NOw of Cibation I turne my pen to write,<br/>
Sith it must here the seuenth place occupie:<br/>
But in few words it wilbe expedite,<br/>
Take heede therefore, and vnderstand me wittelie;<br/>
Cibation is called a feeding of our matter drie,<br/>
With milke and meate, which moderately thou doe,<br/>
Vntill it be brought the third order vnto.

But giue it neuer so much, that thou it glut;<br/>
Beware of dropsey, and also of Noahs flood:<br/>
By little and little therefore thou to it put<br/>
Of meate and drinke, as seemes to doo it good,<br/>
That watry humours not ouergrow the blood,<br/>
To drinke therefore let it be measured so,<br/>
That kindly appetite thou neuer quench it fro.

For if it drinke too much, then must it haue<br/>
A vomit or els it wilbe sick too long,<br/>
From the dropsie therefore thy wombe thou saue,<br/>
And from the fl•x, or els it wilbe wrong,<br/>
But rather let it thirst for drinke among,<br/>
Than thou shouldst giue it ouermuch at once.<br/>
Which must in youth be dieted for the nonce.

---

And if thou diet it (as nature doth require)<br/>
Moderately, till time that it be growen to age,<br/>
From colde it keeping, and nourishing with moyst fire,<br/>
Then shall it growe, and wexe full of courage,<br/>
And doe to thee both pleasure and aduantage:<br/>
For he shall make darke bodies whole and bright,<br/>
Clensing their leprosies through his might.

Three times must thou turne about thy wheele,<br/>
Still keeping the rule of the said Cibation,<br/>
And then as soone as it the fire doth feele,<br/>
Like waxe it wilbe readie vnto liquation:<br/>
This chapter needeth no longer protestation,<br/>
For I haue tolde thee the dietorie most conuenient,<br/>
After thine Elements be made equipolent.

And also how to whitenes thou shalt bring thy golde,<br/>
Most like in figure to leaues of hawthorne tree<br/>
Called Magnesia, afore as I haue tolde,<br/>
And our white Sulphure without combustibilitie,<br/>
Which from the fire away will neuer flie.<br/>
And thus the seuenth Gate (as you desired)<br/>
In the vprising of the Sunne is conquered.

The end of the seuenth Gate.

<h2>Of Sublimation. The eight Gate.</h2>

HEre of our Sublimation a word or two<br/>
I haue to speake, which the eight Gate is.<br/>
Fooles doo sublime, but sublime thou not so,<br/>
For we sublime not as they doe ywis:<br/>
To sublime truly therefore thou shalt not mis,<br/>
If thou canst make thy bodies first spirituall,<br/>
And then thy spirits (as I haue taught thee) corporall.

Some doe Mercurie from vitrioll and salt sublime,<br/>
And other spirits from scales of yron and steele,<br/>
From egg-shels calcined, and from quick lime,<br/>
And in their manner yet sublime they right weele:<br/>
But such subliming accordeth neuer a deele<br/>
To our intents, for we sublime not so,<br/>
To true subliming therefore, now will I goe.

In Sublimation first beware of one thing,<br/>
That thou sublime to the top of the vessell:<br/>
For without violence thou shalt it not downe bring<br/>
Againe, but there it will abide and dwell,<br/>
So it reioyceth with refrigeration I thee tell,<br/>
Keepe it therefore with temperate heate adowne<br/>
Full fortie dayes, till it wexe blacke and browne.

---

For then the soule beginneth to come out<br/>
From his owne veynes, for all that subtill is<br/>
Will with the spirite ascend withouten doubt,<br/>
Beare in thy minde therefore, and thinke on this,<br/>
How here eclipsed been thy bodies,<br/>
As they doe putrifie subliming more and more<br/>
Into water, vntill they be all vp ybore.

And thus their venome when they haue spued out<br/>
Into the water then blacke it doth appeare,<br/>
Becomming spirituall each deale without doubt,<br/>
Subliming easilie in our manner,<br/>
Into the water, which doth him beare:<br/>
For in the ayre our childe must thus be bore<br/>
Of the water againe, as I haue said before.

But when these two by Sublimation continuall<br/>
Be laboured so with heate both moyst and temperate,<br/>
That all is white and purely made spirituall,<br/>
Then heauen vpon earth must be reiterate<br/>
Vntill the soule with the bodie be incorporate<br/>
That earth become all that before was heauen,<br/>
Which wilbe done in Sublimations seauen.

And Sublimations we make for causes three,<br/>
The first cause is, to make the bodie spirituall;<br/>
The second is, that the spirite may corpora•l bee,<br/>
And become fixt with it, and consubstantiall;<br/>
The third cause is, that from his filthie originall<br/>
He may be cleansed, and his saltnes sulphurious<br/>
May be minished in him, which is infectious.

---

Then when they thus together depured be,<br/>
They will sublime vp whiter than the snowe▪<br/>
That sight will greatly comfort thee:<br/>
For then anon perfectly thou shalt knowe<br/>
The spirits shall so adowne ythrowe,<br/>
That this eight Gate shalbe to thee vnlocked,<br/>
Out of the which many be shut and mocked.

The end of the eight Gate.

<h2>Of Firmentation. The ninth Gate.</h2>

TRue Firmentation few Workers vnderstand,<br/>
That secret therefore I will expound to thee,<br/>
I trauailed truly through manie a Land,<br/>
Ere euer I might finde any that would tell it mee:<br/>
Yet as God would, euermore blessed be hee,<br/>
At the last I came to the knowledge thereof perfite,<br/>
Take heede therefore what I thereof doe write.

Firmentations in diuers manners be doone,<br/>
By which our medicine must be perpetuate<br/>
Into cleere water: some looseth Sunne and Moone,<br/>
And with their medicines make them to be congelate;<br/>
Which in the fire when they be examinate<br/>
May not abide, nor alter with complement:<br/>
For such Firmenting is not to our intent.

---

But yet more kindly some other men doone,<br/>
Fermenting their medicines in this wise,<br/>
In Mercurie dissoluing both Sunne and Moone,<br/>
Till time with the spirit they will arise,<br/>
Subliming them together twice or thrice;<br/>
Then Fermentation therewith they make:<br/>
That is a way, but yet we it forsake.

Some other there be which haue more hap,<br/>
To touch the troth in part of fermenting,<br/>
They amalgame their bodies with Mercurie like pap,<br/>
Then therevpon their medicines relenting:<br/>
These of our secrets haue some henting.<br/>
But not the truth with perfect complement,<br/>
Because they neither putrifie, nor alter their Ferment.

That poynt therefore I will disclose vnto thee,<br/>
Looke how thou didst with thine vnperfect bodie,<br/>
Doe so with thy perfect bodies in each degree,<br/>
That is to say, first thou them putrifie,<br/>
Their former qualities destroying vtterly,<br/>
For this is wholly to our intent,<br/>
That first thou alter before thou ferment.

To thy compound make firment the fourth part,<br/>
Which ferments been only of Sunne and Moone;<br/>
If thou therefore be maister of this Arte,<br/>
Thy Fermentation let thus be doone,<br/>
Fixe water and earth together soone,<br/>
And when thy medicine as waxe doth flowe,<br/>
Then vpon malgames looke thou it throwe.

---

And when all that together is mixed,<br/>
Aboue the glasse well closed make thy fire,<br/>
And so continue it till all be fixed,<br/>
And well fermented to thy defire,<br/>
Then make Proiection after thy pleasure,<br/>
For that is medicine each deale perfite,<br/>
Thus must thou ferment both red and white.

For like as flowre of wheate made into paste<br/>
Requireth ferment, which leauen we call<br/>
Of bread, that it may haue the kindly taste,<br/>
And become foode to man and woman cordiall:<br/>
Right so thy medicine ferment thou shall,<br/>
That it may taste of the Ferment pure,<br/>
At all assayes for euer to endure.

And vnderstand that there be Ferments three,<br/>
Two be of bodies in nature cleene,<br/>
Which must be altred as I haue told thee;<br/>
The third most secret of which I meene,<br/>
Is the first earth of his water greene:<br/>
And therefore when the Lion doth thurst,<br/>
Make him to drinke till his belly burst.

Of this a Question if I should mooue,<br/>
And aske of workers, what is this thing?<br/>
Anon thereby I should them prooue,<br/>
If they had knowledge of our fermenting:<br/>
For manie a man speaketh with wondring,<br/>
Of Robin hood and of his bowe,<br/>
Which neuer shot therein I trowe.

---

For Fermentation true as I thee tell,<br/>
Is of the soule with the bodies incorporation,<br/>
Restoring to it the kindly smell,<br/>
With tast and colour by naturall conspissation,<br/>
Of things disseuered, a due reintegration,<br/>
Whereby the bodie of the spirit taketh impression,<br/>
That either the other may help to haue ingression.

For like as bodies in their compaction corporall,<br/>
May not shewe out their qualities effectually,<br/>
Vntill the time that they become spirituall,<br/>
No more may spirits abide with bodies stedfastly,<br/>
Till they with them be confixate proportionally,<br/>
For then the bodie teacheth the spirit to suffer fire,<br/>
And the spirit the bodie to enter to thy defire.

Therefore thy gold with gold thou must ferment,<br/>
With his owne water thy earth cleansed I meene,<br/>
Nought else to say but element with element,<br/>
The spirit of life onely going betweene,<br/>
For like as an adamant as thou hast seene<br/>
Draweth yron to him, so doth our earth by kinde,<br/>
Drawe downe to him his soule borne vp with winde.

With winde therefore the soule lead out and in,<br/>
Mingle gold with gold, that is for to say,<br/>
Make Element with Element togetherrin<br/>
Till time all fire they suffer may,<br/>
For earth is Ferment withouten nay<br/>
To water, and water the earth vnto,<br/>
Our Fermentatio• in this wise must be doe.

---

Earth is gold, and so is the soule also<br/>
Not common, but ours thus Elementate,<br/>
And yet thereto the Sunne must goe,<br/>
That by our wheele it may be alterate:<br/>
For so to ferment it must be preparate,<br/>
That it profoundly may ioyned bee,<br/>
With other natures as I said to thee.

And whatsoeuer I haue here said of gold,<br/>
The same of siluer I will thou vnderstand,<br/>
That thou them putrifie and alter (as I haue told)<br/>
Ere thou thy medicine to firment take in hand:<br/>
Forsooth I could neuer finde him in England<br/>
Which in this wise to firment could me teach<br/>
Withouten error, by practise or by speach.

Now of this chapter needeth to treate no more,<br/>
Sith I intend prolixitie to eschew;<br/>
Remember well my words therefore,<br/>
Which thou shalt proue by practise trew,<br/>
And Sunne and Moone looke thou renew,<br/>
That they may hold of the fift nature,<br/>
Then shall their tincture euermore endure.

And yet a way there is most excellent,<br/>
Belonging vnto another working,<br/>
A water we make most redolent,<br/>
All bodies to oyle wherewith we bring,<br/>
With which our medicine we make flowing,<br/>
A quintessence this water we call,<br/>
In man which healeth diseases all.

---

But with thy base, after my doctrine preperate<br/>
Which is our calx this must be done,<br/>
For when our bodies be so calcinate,<br/>
That water will to oyle dissolue them soone,<br/>
Make thou therefore oyle both of Sunne and Moone,<br/>
Which is ferment most fragrant for to smell.<br/>
And so the ninth gate is conquered of this Castell.

The end of the ninth Gate.

<h2>Of Exaltation. The tenth Gate.</h2>

PRoceede we now to the chapter of Exaltation,<br/>
Of which truly thou must haue knowledge pure,<br/>
But little it is different from Sublimation,<br/>
If thou conceiue it right I you ensure,<br/>
Hereto accordeth the holy scripture,<br/>
Christ saying thus, if I exalted be,<br/>
Then shall I draw all things vnto me.

---

Our medicine if we exalt right so,<br/>
It shalbe thereby nobilitate,<br/>
That must be done in manners two,<br/>
From time the parties be dispousate,<br/>
Which must be crucified and examinate,<br/>
And then contumulate both man and wife,<br/>
And after reuiued by the spirit of life.

Then vp to heauen they must exalted be,<br/>
There to be in bodie and soule glorificate,<br/>
For thou must bring them to such subtiltie,<br/>
that they ascend together to be intronizate,<br/>
In cloudes of clearenes to Angels consociate,<br/>
Then shall they draw as thou shalt see,<br/>
Al other bodies to their owne dignitee.

If thou therefore the bodies wilt exalt,<br/>
First with the spirit of life thou them augment,<br/>
till time the earth be well subtilizate,<br/>
By naturall rectifying of euery Element,<br/>
Them vp exalting into the firmament,<br/>
Then much more precious shall they be than gold,<br/>
Because of the quintessence which they doe holde.

For when the colde hath ouercome the heate,<br/>
Then into water the Ayre shall turned be,<br/>
And so two contraries together shall meete,<br/>
Till either with orher right well agree,<br/>
So into Ayre the water as I tell thee,<br/>
When heate of colde hath got domination,<br/>
Shall be conuerted by craft of our circulation.

---

And of the Ayre then fire haue thou shall,<br/>
By loosing putrifying and subliming,<br/>
And fire thou hast of the earth materiall,<br/>
Thine Elements thus by craft disseuering,<br/>
Most especially thine earth well calcining,<br/>
And when they be each one made pure,<br/>
Then doe they holde all of the first nature.

On this wise therefore make them be circulate,<br/>
Each into other exalting by and by,<br/>
And all in this one glasse surely sigillate,<br/>
Not with thine hands, but as I teach thee naturally,<br/>
Fire into water then turne first hardly,<br/>
For fire is in Ayre, which is in water existent,<br/>
And this conuersion accordeth to our intent.

Then furthermore turne on thy wheele,<br/>
That into earth the ayre conuerted be,<br/>
Which will be done also right well,<br/>
For Ayre is in water being in earth trust me,<br/>
The water into fire contrarious in her qualitie,<br/>
Soone turne thou mayst for water in earth is,<br/>
Which is in fire, conuersion true is this.

The wheele is now neere turned about,<br/>
Into ayre turne earrh which is the proper nest,<br/>
Of other Elements there is no doubt,<br/>
For earth in fire is, which in ayre taketh rest,<br/>
This circulation beginne thou in the west,<br/>
Then into the south, till they exalted bee,<br/>
Proceede duely, as in thy figure I haue taught thee.

---

In which processe clearely thou mayst see,<br/>
Frō one extreame how to another thou mayst not go,<br/>
But by a meane, since they in qualities contrarious be,<br/>
And reason will forsooth that it be so,<br/>
As heate into colde, with other contraries •o,<br/>
Without their meanes as moyst to heate and colde,<br/>
Examples sufficient before this I haue tolde.

Thus haue I taught thee how to make<br/>
Of all thine Elements a perfect circulation,<br/>
And at thy figure example to take,<br/>
How thou shalt make this foresaide Exaltation,<br/>
And of thy medicine in the Elements true graduation,<br/>
Till it be brought to a gueneritie temperate,<br/>
And then thou hast conquered the tenth gate.

The end of the tenth Gate.

<h2>Of Multiplication. The eleuenth Gate.</h2>

MVltiplication now to declare I proceede,<br/>
Which is by Philosophers in this wise defined<br/>
Augmentation it is of the Elixer indeede,<br/>
In goodnes and quantitie both for white and red,<br/>
Multiplication is therefore as they doe write,<br/>
That thing that doth augmēt medicines in each degree,<br/>
In colour, in odour, in vertue and also in quantitee.

---

And why thou mayst this medicine multiplie,<br/>
Infinitely forsooth the cause is this,<br/>
For it is fire, which kindled will neuer die,<br/>
Dwelling with thee, as fire doth in houses,<br/>
Of which one sparke may make more fire ywis,<br/>
As muske in pigments and other spices mo,<br/>
In vertue multiplied, and our medicine right so.

So he is rich which fire hath lesse or more,<br/>
Because he may so hugely it multiply,<br/>
And right so rich is he which any parte hath in store,<br/>
Of our Elixers which be augmentable infinitely,<br/>
One way if thou dissolue our pouders drye,<br/>
And make often times of them Congelation,<br/>
Thereof in goodnes then makest thou Augmentation.

The second way both in goodnes and quantitie,<br/>
It multiplyeth by iterate Fermentation,<br/>
As in that chapter I shewed plainely to thee,<br/>
By diuers manners of naturall operation,<br/>
And also in the chapter of our Cibation,<br/>
Where thou mayst know how thou shalt multiplie,<br/>
Thy medicine with Mercurie infinitely.

But and thou wilt both loose and eke ferment,<br/>
Both more in quantitie and better will it be:<br/>
And in such wise thou mayst it soone augment,<br/>
That in thy glasse it will growe like a tree,<br/>
The tree of Hermes named seemely to see,<br/>
Of which one pippin a thousand will multiplie,<br/>
If thou canst make thy proiection wittely.

---

And like as Saffron when it is puluerizate,<br/>
By little and little if it with liquor be<br/>
Tempred, and then with much more liquor dilate,<br/>
Teyneth much more of liquor in quantitie,<br/>
Thā being whole in his grosse nature: so shalt thou see,<br/>
That our Elixer, the more it is made thinne,<br/>
The further in tincture it fastly will rinne.

Keepe in thy fire therefore both euen and morrow,<br/>
From house to house that thou neede not to rinne,<br/>
Among thy neighbours thy fire to seeke or borrow,<br/>
The more thou keepest, the more good shalt thou win<br/>
Multiplying it alwaies more & more thy glasse within,<br/>
By feeding with Mercurie vnto thy liues end,<br/>
So shalt thou haue more than thou needest to spend.

This matter is plaine I will no more<br/>
Write thereof, let reason thee guide,<br/>
Be neuer the bolder to sinne therefore,<br/>
But serue thy God the better in each tide:<br/>
And while that thou shalt in this life abide,<br/>
Beare this in minde, forget not I thee pray,<br/>
As thou shalt appeare before God at domes day.

His owne great giftes therefore and his treasure,<br/>
Dispose thou vertuously, helping the poore at neede,<br/>
That in this world thou mayst to thee procure,<br/>
Mercy and grace with heauenly blisse to meede,<br/>
And pray to God deuoutly that he thee leade,<br/>
In at the twelfth gate, as he can best,<br/>
Soone after then thou shalt end thy conquest.

The end of the eleuenth gate.

---

<h2>Of Proiection. The twelfth Gate.</h2>

IN Proiection it shal be proued if our practise be pro∣fitable,<br/>
Of which it behoueth me the secrets here to moue,<br/>
Therefore if thy tincture be sure and not variable,<br/>
By a little of thy medicine thus mayst thou proue,<br/>
With mettle, or with Mercury as pitch it will cleaue,<br/>
And teyne in Proiection all fires to abide,<br/>
And soone it will enter and spread him full wide.

But many by ignorance doe marre that they made,<br/>
When on mettals vnclensed Proiection they make,<br/>
For because of corruption their tinctures must fade,<br/>
Which they would not away first from the body take,<br/>
Which after Proiection be brittle blew and black,<br/>
That thy tincture therefore may euermore last,<br/>
First vpon ferment thy medicine see thou cast.

Then brittle as glasse will thy ferment bee,<br/>
Vpon bodies clensed and made very pure,<br/>
Cast that brittle substance and soone shalt thou see,<br/>
That they shall be curiously coloured with tincture,<br/>
With all assayes for euer shall endure,<br/>
But profitable Proiection perfectly to make,<br/>
At the Psalmes of the Psalter example thou take.

---

On Fundamenta cast first this psalme Nunc di••ittis,<br/>
Vpon verba mea, then cast Fundamenta beliue,<br/>
Then Verba vpon diligam, conceiue me with thy wits.<br/>
And diligam vpon attendite, if thou list to thriue,<br/>
Thus make thou Proiections, three, foure, or fiue,<br/>
Till the tincture of the medicine beginne to decrease,<br/>
And then it is time of Proiection to cease.

By this mistie talking I meane nothing else,<br/>
But that thou must cast first the lesse on the more,<br/>
Encreasing aye the number as wisemen thee tells,<br/>
And keepe thou this secreat vnto thy selfe in store,<br/>
Be couetous of cunning it is no burden sore,<br/>
For he that ioyneth not the Elixer with bodies made cleane,<br/>
He wotteth not surely what Proiection doth meane

Ten if thou multiplie first into ten,<br/>
One hundreth that number maketh sickerly,<br/>
If one hundreth into an hundreth be multiplied, then<br/>
Ten thousand is that number if thou count it wittely,<br/>
Then into as much more ten thousand to multiplie,<br/>
It is a thousand thousand; which multiplied ywis,<br/>
Into as much more a hundreth millions is.

That hundreth millions being multiplyed likewise<br/>
Into ten thousand millions, as I to thee doe say,<br/>
Maketh so great a number I wot not what it is,<br/>
Thy number in Proiection thus multiplye alway:<br/>
Now childe of thy curtesie for me that thou pray,<br/>
Sith I haue tolde thee our secrets all and some,<br/>
To the which I beseech GOD by grace thou mayst come.

---

Now hast thou conquered these gates twelue,<br/>
And all the Castle thou holdest at thy will,<br/>
Keepe thy secreats in store to thy selfe,<br/>
And the commaundements of God looke thou fulfill,<br/>
In fire see thou continue thy glasses still,<br/>
And multiply thy medicines aye more and more,<br/>
For wise men doe say, that store is no sore.

Recapitulatio totius operis praedicti.<br/>
For to bring this Treatise to a finall ende,<br/>
And briefly here to conclude these secrets all,<br/>
Diligently looke thou, and to thy figure attend,<br/>
Which doth in it containe these secrets great & small,<br/>
And if thou it conceiue, both theoricall and practicall,<br/>
By figures and colours, by scripture plaine,

It wittily conceiued, thou mayst not worke in vaine.

---

Consider first the latitude of this precious Stone,<br/>
Beginning in the first side noted in the West,<br/>
Where the red man & the white woman be made one,<br/>
Spoused with the spirite of life to liue in rest,<br/>
Earth and water equally proportionate, that is best,<br/>
And one of the earth is good, and of the spirit three,<br/>
Which twelue to fowre also of the earth may bee.

Three of the wife, and one of the man thou take,<br/>
And the lesse of the spirit in this dispousation,<br/>
The rather thy Calcination for certain shalt thou make:<br/>
Then forth into the North proceed by obscuration<br/>
Of the red man and his white wife, called Eclipsation,<br/>
Loosing them and altring them betwixt winter & vere,<br/>
Into water turning earth, darke and nothing cleare.

From thence by colours many one into the East ascend,<br/>
Then shall the Moone be full appearing by day-light,<br/>
Then is she passed purgatorie, and her course at an end,<br/>
There is the vprising of the Sunne appearing bright.<br/>
There is Summer after Vere, and day after night:<br/>
Thē earth & water which wer black, be turned to aire,<br/>
And clouds of darknes ouerblown, & all apeareth faire.

And as in the west was the beginning of thy practise.<br/>
And the North the perfect meane of profoūd alteratiō:<br/>
So in the East after them the beginning of speculatiō is:<br/>
But of this course vp in the south the sun maketh cōsū∣matiō.<br/>
Ther bin the elements turned into fire by circulatiō:<br/>
Then to win to thy desire thou needst not be in doubt,<br/>
For the wheele of our philosophie thou hast turned a∣bout

---

But yet about againe two times turne thy wheele,<br/>
In which bin cōprehēded all the secrets of our philoso∣phy.<br/>
In chapiters 12. made plaine to thee, if thou cōceiue thē well,<br/>
And all the secrets by & by of our lower Astronomy,<br/>
How thou shalt calcine bodies, perfit, dissolue diuide & putrifie,<br/>
With perfect knowledge of all the poles which in our heauen beene,<br/>
Shining with colours inexplicable, neuer were gayer seene.

And thus our secret conclusion know withouten faile,<br/>
Our red man teineth not, nor his wife, til they teined be,<br/>
Therefore if thou list thy selfe by this craft to auaile,<br/>
The altitude of the bodies hide, & shewe out their pro∣funditie,<br/>
In euery of thy materials destroying the first qualitie,<br/>
And secondary qualities more glorious in them repaire anone,<br/>
And in one glasse, and with one rule, foure natures turn to one.

Pale & black with false citrine, imperfect white & red,<br/>
The Peacocks feathers in colours gay, the Rainebowe which shall ouergoe,<br/>
The spotted pāther, the lyō green, the crowes bil blue as lead,<br/>
These shall apeare before thee perfect white, and manie other moe,<br/>
And after the perfect white, gray, false citrine also,<br/>
And after these, thē shall apeare the body red inuariable,<br/>
Then hast thou a medicine of the thirde order of his owne kinde multiplicable.

---

Thou must diuide thy white Elixer into parts two<br/>
Before thou rubifie, & into glasses two let thē be doone.<br/>
If thou wilt haue for Sū & moon thy elixer both do so;<br/>
And into mercury thē multiply to great quātity soone,<br/>
And if thou had not at the beginning to fill a spoone,<br/>
Yet maist thou them so multiply both white and red.<br/>
That if thou liue a 1000. yeres, they shall stād thee in sted.

Haue thou recourse to thy wheele therefore I counsell thee,<br/>
And studie him well to know in each chapter truly,<br/>
Meddle with no phantasticall multipliers, but let thē be,<br/>
Which will thee flatter feining them cunning in Phi∣losophie,<br/>
Doe as I bid thee, thē dissolue these foresaid bases wit∣tilie,<br/>
And turne them into perfect oyles with our true water ardent,<br/>
By circulation that must be done according to our in∣tent.

These oyles will fixe crude Mercurie and conuert bo∣dies all<br/>
Into perfect Sunne and Moone, when thou shalt make Proiection;<br/>
That oylie substance pure & fixt Raimond Lully did call<br/>
His Basiliske, of which he neuer made so plain detectiō:<br/>
Pray for me to God, that I may be one of his election,<br/>
And that he will for one of his, at doomesday me ken▪<br/>
And graunt me his blisse to raigne with him for euer. Amen.

Finis Recapitulationis.

---

An Admonition, wherein the Author declareth his erronious Experiments.<br/>
AFter all this, I will thou vnderstand<br/>
For thy sauegard, what I haue doone,<br/>
Manie experiments haue I taken in hand<br/>
As I found written for Sunne and Moone:<br/>
The which I will tell thee, rehearsing soone,<br/>
Beginning at the vermilion, which proued nought,

And Mercurie sublimed, which I dearly bought.<br/>
I made solutions full manie a one<br/>
Of spirits, ferments, salts, yron, and steele,<br/>
Weening so to make the Philosophers Stone:<br/>
But finally I lost euery deele,<br/>
After my bookes yet wrought I weele,<br/>
Which euermore vntrue I preeued,

Which made me oft full sore agreeued.<br/>
Waters corsiue and waters ardent,<br/>
With which I wrought in diuers wise,<br/>
Manie one I made, but all were shent,<br/>
Egg-shells I calcined twice or thrise,<br/>
Oyles from Calxes I made vp to rise,<br/>
And euery Element I did from other twin,

But profit found I none therein.

---

Also I wrought in sulphure and vitriall,<br/>
Which fooles doe call the greene Lyon,<br/>
In Arsinike, in orpiment, foule them befall,<br/>
In debili principio was my inception,<br/>
Therefore in fine, was fraude my conclusion:<br/>
And thus I blew my thrift at the cole,<br/>
My cloathes were bawdie, my stomacke neuer whole.

Sal Armoniacke, and Sandiuere,<br/>
Sal Alcalie, Sal allembroke, and Sal attinckarre,<br/>
Sal tartar, salt common, Sal gem most cleare,<br/>
Salt Peter, salt sod, of these beware,<br/>
And from the odour of quicksiluer keepe thee farre,<br/>
Meddle not with Mercurie precipitate,<br/>
Neither with imperfect bodies rubificate.

I prooued vrine, eggs, haire and blood,<br/>
The soule of Saturne, and also of markazite,<br/>
Aes vst, and Crokefeere, which did me neuer good,<br/>
And the scales of yron which Smithes of smite,<br/>
Litarge and Antimonie, not worth a mite;<br/>
Of the which gay tinctures did I shew,<br/>
Both red and white, which were vntrew.

Oyle of lyme, and water with labour great<br/>
I made, calcining it with salt preperate,<br/>
And by it selfe with violent heate,<br/>
Grinding with vineger till I was fatigate,<br/>
And also with aqua vitae, with spices acuate<br/>
Vpon a marble Stone, which stood me in cost,<br/>
And oyles with corosiues I made; but all was lost.

---

Manie a Malgame did I make,<br/>
Weening to fixe them to great auaile,<br/>
And thereto Sulphure did I take,<br/>
Tartar, egges, whites, and oyle of the snayle,<br/>
But euer of my purpose did I faile,<br/>
For what for the more, and what for the las,<br/>
Euermore something wanting there was.

Wine and milke, oyles and rennyt,<br/>
The slyme of starres that fall on ground,<br/>
Celedonie with Secundines and many mo yet;<br/>
In these I practised as I in bookes found,<br/>
I wan right nought, but lost many a pound,<br/>
Of Mercurie and mettalls I made christall stones,<br/>
Weening it had been a worke for the nones.

Thus I rosted and broyled, as one of Gebers cookes,<br/>
Oft times in the asshes my winning I sought,<br/>
For I was deceiued by manie false bookes,<br/>
Whereby vntruth truly I wrought,<br/>
But all such experiments auailed me right nought,<br/>
But brought me in danger and encumbrance,<br/>
By losse of my goods and other greeuance.

For the loue of our Ladie such lewdnes eschew,<br/>
And medle with no falshood, that neuer proued weele,<br/>
Assay when thee liketh, and thou shalt finde it trew,<br/>
Winne shalt thou right nought, but lose euerie deele,<br/>
Pence in thy purse pawtner few shalt thou feele,<br/>
In smokes and in smels thou shalt haue much woe,<br/>
That vnneth for sicknes on earth thou shalt goe.

---

I sawe neuer true worke truly but one,<br/>
Of which in this Treatise the truth I haue told:<br/>
Studie only therefore how to make our Stone,<br/>
For thereby maist thou winne both siluer and gold,<br/>
Vpon my writing therefore, to ground thee be bold:<br/>
So shalt thou loose nought if God be thy guide,<br/>
Trust to my doctrine, and thereby abide.

Remember that Man is most noble creature<br/>
Of earthly composition, that euer God wrought,<br/>
In whō is the foure Elements, proportioned by nature,<br/>
A naturall Mercurialitie, which costeth right nought,<br/>
One of his myner by arte it is brought;<br/>
For our mettalls be nought els but our myners two,<br/>
Of Sunne and Moone, wise Raymond said so.

The clearnes of the Moone, and of the Sunne so bright,<br/>
Into these two myners descendeth secretly,<br/>
Howbeit the clearnes is hid from thy sight,<br/>
Which by craft thou shalt make it to appeare openly:<br/>
This hid Stone, this one thing therefore putrifie,<br/>
And wash him in his owne broth till white he become;<br/>
Then ferment him wittily; loe here is all and some.

Now to God Almightie I thee commend,<br/>
Who graunt thee grace to knowe this one thing;<br/>
For now is this Treatise brought to an end:<br/>
And God for his mercie to his blisse vs bring,<br/>
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus where the Angells doe sing,<br/>
Praising without ceasing his glorious Maiestie,<br/>
Which he in his Kingdome graunt vs for to see.

Amen quod George Ripley.

The Epistle by the same Author written to King Edward the 4.<br/>
O Honorable Lord, and most victorious Knight,<br/>
With grace and vertue abundantly endewed,<br/>
The safegard of England, and maintainer of right;<br/>
That God you loueth, indeed he hath well shewed:<br/>
Wherefore I trust this land shalbe renewed<br/>
With ioy and riches, with charitie and peace,

So that olde ranckors new vnderstrewed,<br/>
Tempestuous troubles, and wretchednes shall cease.<br/>
And therefore sith I see by tokens right euident,<br/>
That God you guideth, and how that you be vertuous,<br/>
Hating sinne, and all such as be insolent,<br/>
How that also manslaughter to you is odious,<br/>
Vpon the iudgement also that you be piteous:

Me seemeth ruthe it were but that you should liue long;<br/>
For of your great fortune you are not presumptuous,<br/>
Nor vengeable of spirit to reuenge you of each wrong.<br/>
These considered with others in your most noble State,<br/>
Like as God knoweth, and people doe witnes beare,<br/>
So entirely me m•oueth, that I must algate<br/>
Record the same, and therein be no flatterer:

And not that only, but also to write here<br/>
Vnto your Highnes, humbly to present<br/>
Great secrets, which infarre countries I did learne,<br/>
And which by grace to me most vnworthie are lent.

---

Once to your Lordship such things I did promise,<br/>
What time you did commaund to send vnto me,<br/>
And sith that I wrote it in secret wise,<br/>
Vnto your grace from the Vniuersitie<br/>
Of Louaine, when God fortuned me by grace to see<br/>
Greater secrets and much more perfite,<br/>
Which onely to you I will disclosed to be,

That is the great Elixer both red and white.<br/>
For like it you to trust that truly I haue found,<br/>
The perfect way of most secret Alchymie,<br/>
Which I will neuer truly for marke nor for pound<br/>
Make common but to you, and that conditionally,<br/>
That to youre selfe you shall keepe it full secretly,<br/>
And only to vse it as may be to Gods pleasure,

Else in time comming to God I should abye,<br/>
For my discouering of his secret treasure.<br/>
Therefore be you well aduised and with good deliberation,<br/>
For of this secret shall know no other creature,<br/>
But onely you as J make faithfull protestation,<br/>
For all the time that herein life J shall endure,<br/>
Whereto J will your Lordship me ensure,

To my desire in this my oath for to agree,<br/>
Least I to me the wrath of God procure,<br/>
For such reuealing of his great gift and priuitie.<br/>
If God fortune you by me to win this treasure,<br/>
Serue him deuowtly with more lawde and thanking,<br/>
Praying his Godhead in life that you may so endure,<br/>
His gifts of grace, and fortune to vse to his pleasing,

Most especially intending ouer all thing,<br/>
To your power and cunning his precepts ten<br/>
So to obserue, that into no danger your selfe you bring,<br/>
But that you in glory may see him hereafter, Amen.

---

And yet moreouer I will your Lordship to pardon me,<br/>
For openly with pen I will it neuer it write,<br/>
But whensoeuer you list by practise you shall see,<br/>
By mouth also this precious secret, most of delight,<br/>
How may be made perfect Elixers both red and white,<br/>
Plaine vnto your Lordship it shall declared be,<br/>
And if it please you, with easie expences and respite,

I will them worke by grace of the Trinitie.<br/>
But notwithstanding for perill that may befall,<br/>
If I dare not here plainely the knotte vnbinde,<br/>
Yet in my writing I will not be so misticall,<br/>
But that by studie the true knowledge you may finde,<br/>
How that each thing is multiplied in his kinde,<br/>
And how the likenes of bodies metaline be transmutable

I will declare, that if you feele me in your minde,<br/>
My writing you shall finde true and no fained fable.<br/>
As Philosophers in the m•the•rs doe write,<br/>
The likenes of bodies mataline be not transmutable,<br/>
But after he added these wordes of more delight,<br/>
Without they be reduced to their beginning materiable,<br/>
Wherefore such bodies within nature be liquiable,

Minerall and metaline may be mercurizate,<br/>
Conceiue you may this science is not opinionable,<br/>
But very true, by Raymond and others determinate,<br/>
In the saide booke the Philosophers speake also,<br/>
Therein if it please your Highnes for to reade,<br/>
Of diuers sulphures, and especially of two,<br/>
And of two mercuries ioyned to them indeed,

Whereby he doth true vnderstanders leade,<br/>
To the knowledge of the principle which is onely trew,<br/>
Both red, moist, pure, and white, as I haue espied,<br/>
Which be neuerthelesse found but of verie few.

---

And these two things be best, he addeth anone<br/>
For him that worketh the Alchymie to take:<br/>
Our golde and our siluer therewith to make all one,<br/>
Wherefore I say who will our pearle and Ruby make,<br/>
The said principles looke he not forsake:<br/>
For at the beginning, if his principles be true,<br/>
And if so be by craft he can them also bake,

In th'end truly his worke he shall not rue.<br/>
But one great secret right needfull to be knowne,<br/>
That though the Philosophers speake plurally,<br/>
All is but one thing you may me well trowe,<br/>
In kinde which is our base principally,<br/>
Whereof doth spring both white and red naturally,<br/>
And yet the white must come first out of the red,

Which thing is not wrought manually,<br/>
But naturally, craft helping out of our lead.<br/>
For all the partes of our most precious stone,<br/>
As I can proue, be coessentiall and concrete,<br/>
Moreouer there is no true principle but one,<br/>
Full long it was ere I therewith could meete,<br/>
Who can reduce him and knoweth his heate,

And onely kinde with kinde can well redresse,<br/>
Till filthie originall be clensed from his seate,<br/>
He likely is to finde our secrets more and lesse.<br/>
Therefore worke kinde onely with his owne kinde,<br/>
And so your Elements ioyne that they not striue▪<br/>
This poynt also for any beare in minde,<br/>
That passiue natures you turne into actiue,

Of water, fire, and winde of earth make bliue,<br/>
And of the quadrangle make a figure round,<br/>
Then haue thou the honie of our bee-hiue,<br/>
One ounce well worth one thousand pound.

---

The principall secret of secrets all,<br/>
Is true proportion which may not be behinde,<br/>
Wherein I counsell thee be not superficiall,<br/>
The true conclusion if you thinke to finde,<br/>
Turne earth into water and water into winde,<br/>
Therefore make fire and beware of the flood<br/>
Of Noah, wherein many men are so blinde,

That by this science they get little good.<br/>
I counsell you eate and drink temperately,<br/>
And beware well that Iposarcha come not in place,<br/>
Neshe not your wombe by drinking immoderately,<br/>
Least you quench naturall heate in little space,<br/>
The colour will tell appearing in your face,<br/>
Drinke no more therefore than you may eate,

Walke vp and downe after an easie pace,<br/>
Chafe not your bodie too sore to sweate.<br/>
With easie fire after mouing when you sweate,<br/>
Warme your bodie and make it drie againe,<br/>
By riuers and fountaines walke after meate,<br/>
At morning time visit the high mountaine,<br/>
That Phisick so biddeth I read certaine,

So high the mountaines yet doe you not ascend,<br/>
But that you may downwardes your way haue plaine,<br/>
And with your mantle from colde ye you defend.<br/>
Such labour is wholesome your sweat for to drie<br/>
With napkin, and after it see you take no colde,<br/>
For grosse humors be purged by sweate kindely,<br/>
Vse Diacameron then confect with perfect golde,

Hermidocles for watry humors good I holde,<br/>
Vse Jpericon perforat with milke of tincturiall,<br/>
And sperma Caeti with red wine, and when you wax olde,<br/>
And Goats milke sod with wine nourisheth moysture radicall.

---

But a good Phisition who so intendeth to be,<br/>
Our lower Astronomie needeth well to know,<br/>
And after that to learne well vrine in a glasse to see,<br/>
And if it neede to be chafed the fire for to blow,<br/>
Then wittily it by diuers wayes for to throw<br/>
After the cause to make a medicine bliue,<br/>
Truly telling the infirmities all on a row,

Who this can doe by his Phisick is like to thriue.<br/>
VVe haue our heauen incorruptible of the quintessence,<br/>
Ornate with signes, Elements, and starres bright,<br/>
VVhich moysteth our earth by subtill influence,<br/>
And of it a secret sulphure hid from sight,<br/>
It fetcheth by vertue of his actiue might,<br/>
Like as the Bee fetcheth honey out of the flower,

VVhich thing could doe no other worldly wight.<br/>
Therefore to God be all glory and honour.<br/>
And like as yee to water doth relent,<br/>
VVhere it was congealed by violence of colde,<br/>
VVhen Phoebus it shineth with his heate influent,<br/>
Euen so to water minerall reduced is our golde,<br/>
As witnesseth plainely, Albert, Raymond, and Arnold,

By heate and moysture and by craft occasionate,<br/>
VVhich congelation of the spirits, loe now J haue tolde,<br/>
How our materialls together must be proportionate.<br/>
At the dyers craft you may learne this science,<br/>
Beholding with water how decoction they make<br/>
Vpon the wad or madder easily and with patience,<br/>
Till tinctures doe appeare which then the cloth doth take,

Therein so fixed that they will neuer forsake<br/>
The cloth, for washing after they ioyned be,<br/>
Euen so our tinctures with the water of our lake,<br/>
VVe draw by boyling vvith the ashes of Hermes tree.

---

Which tinctures when they by craft are made perfite,<br/>
So dyeth mettles with colours aye permanent,<br/>
After the qualitie of the medicine, red or white,<br/>
That neuer away with anie fire wilbe brent:<br/>
To this example if you take good tent,<br/>
Vnto your purpose the rather you shall winne.<br/>
And let your fire be easie, and not too feruent,

Where nature did leaue what time you did beginne.<br/>
First calcine, and after that putrifie,<br/>
Dissolue, distill, sublime, discend and fixe,<br/>
With Aqua vitae oft times both wash and drie,<br/>
And make a marriage the bodie and spirite betwixt,<br/>
Which thus together naturallie if you can mixe,<br/>
In loosing of the bodie the water congeald shalbe,

Then shall the bodie die vtterlie of the flixe,<br/>
Bleeding and changing his colours, as you shall see.<br/>
The third day againe to life he shall arise,<br/>
And deuoure birds, and beasts of the wildernesse,<br/>
Crowes, popingaies, pies, peacocks, and mauois,<br/>
The Phoenix, with the Eagle, and the Griffin of fearfulnesse,<br/>
The greene Lion, with the red Dragon he shall distresse,

With the white Dragon, and the Antelop, Vnicorne & Panther,<br/>
With other beasts and birds both more and lesse,<br/>
The Basiliske also, which almost each one doth feare.<br/>
Jn bus and nibus he shall arise and descend,<br/>
Vp to the Moone, and sith vp to the Sunne,<br/>
Through the Ocean sea, which round is withouten end,<br/>
Onely shippen within a little glassen tunne;

When he is there come, then is the mastrie wonne:<br/>
About which iourney, great goods you shall not spend,<br/>
And yet you shall be glad that euer it was begunne,<br/>
Patiently if you list to your worke attend.

---

For then both bodie and spirite with oyle and water,<br/>
Soule, and tincture, one thing both white and red,<br/>
After colours variable it containeth, whatsouer men clatter;<br/>
Which also is called after he hath once been dead<br/>
And is reuiued, our Markaside, our Magnet, and our lead,<br/>
Our Sulphur, our Arsinike, and our true Calx viue,<br/>
Our Sunne, our Moone, our ferment and our bread,

Our toad, our Basiliske▪ our vnknowen bodie, our man, our wife.<br/>
Our bodie thus naturally by craft when he is renouate<br/>
Of the first order, is medicine called in our Philosophie;<br/>
Which oftentimes againe must be propertualicate,<br/>
The round wheele turning of our Astronomie,<br/>
And so to the Elixer of spirits you must come: for why<br/>
Till the sonne of the fixed by the sonne of the fixer be ouergone,

Elixer of bodies, named it is onely,<br/>
And this found secret poynt, deceaueth manie one.<br/>
This naturall proces by helpe of craft thus consummate,<br/>
Dissolueth Elixer spirituall in our vnctuous humiditie,<br/>
Then in Balneo Mare together let them be circulate,<br/>
Like new honie or oyle, till perfectly they be thickned.<br/>
Then will that medicine heale all infirmitie,

And turne all mettals to Sunne and Moone perfectly,<br/>
Thus you shall make the great Elixer, and Aurum potabile,<br/>
By the grace and will of God, to whom be all honour and glorie.<br/>
Amen. quod George Ripley.
