<h1>Of the Division of Chaos</h1>
<cite>Simon Forman</cite>

Into darkness then did descend the spirit of God,<br/>
Upon the watery chaos, whereon he made his abode.<br/>
Which darkness then was on the face of the deep,<br/>
In which rested the Chaos, and in it all things asleep.<br/>
Rude, unformed, without shape, form or any good,<br/>
Out of which God created all things as it stood.<br/>
But first he commanded a light to appear,<br/>
That all might be seen, that before was hid.<br/>
And God saw that the light was good and clear,<br/>
And the darkness and light he did then divide,<br/>
Calling the one day, and the other night,<br/>
For darkness [to] obscure (and day for shining bright).<br/>
And a firmament then God did let make,<br/>
To sever the waters above from those below;<br/>
And divided the Earth from the waters also,<br/>
Wherein greatly his power he did show.<br/>
Then out of this Chaos, the four elements were made:<br/>
Heat and cold, moist and dry, in like wise,<br/>
Which are the beginning of all creatures wide,<br/>
That under the globe of Luna do abide.<br/>
The quintessence (that some men it call)<br/>
Was taken out of the Chaos before the four elements all:<br/>
Which is the first being, as we may descry,<br/>
And uncorruptible, whereof was made the sky,<br/>
And celestial bodies all, which do never die.

So that of Hyle, nor Chaos, nor quintessence high,<br/>
Is there any generation to multiply,<br/>
In species or kinde here in Earth below,<br/>
Of creatures abiding under the sky,<br/>
But the four elements do make influence,<br/>
By their special power into all things below;<br/>
And into every specific thing do put quintessence,<br/>
To reap such seed thereof: as men do sow,<br/>
But of themselves. As they are simple and pure in kind,<br/>
In every species together conjoined we do them find,<br/>
Creating Sulphur, Salt, and Argent vive -<br/>
The inward bodies of things that make them thrive.<br/>
Whose gross bodies to destroy, if we them have,<br/>
We must not spare thereof to deprave.

Next after this, four elements pure, simple and clear,<br/>
That is, hot and cold, moist and also dry,<br/>
Are assigned to work on four bodies gross,<br/>
The last substance of the Chaos, and of the highest the dross.<br/>
Earth, water, air and fire, therein to show their might,<br/>
And therein to make generation and bring forms to light;<br/>
In every one severally, out creatures to bring,<br/>
Which is the beginning and generation of all things.<br/>
For heat is assigned to the fire, which doth burn;<br/>
Moisture to the air, which doth corrupt and round turn;<br/>
Dryness to the earth, the mother of each thing;<br/>
And coldness to the water, from whence all do spring.<br/>
Heat and moisture are active to generation;<br/>
Cold and dryness are passive, in and to each thing;<br/>
Fire and air, active by elementation;<br/>
Water and earth, passive to generation.<br/>
For in dryness of the earth and in water clear.<br/>
All things are engendered, before they appear.<br/>
According the the conjunction of the four elements,<br/>
In each of their subjects severally,<br/>
Are engendered and brought forth every creature,<br/>
Living or being under the Moon's sky.<br/>
The earth is fixed, durable for ever to abide;<br/>
The air continually moveth from place to place beside,<br/>
And is the life of the fire which purges all;<br/>
And the water (for coldness) destructive, men call.<br/>
But when they are commixed, one with another,<br/>
Not simple, but compound in their elemental qualities,<br/>
Then work they in kind by diversities,<br/>
More or less as they are commixed by degrees.

If these four elements do work in the fire,<br/>
To engender and bring forth some creature,<br/>
As the Salamander, ever living therein,<br/>
You must conceive well of his commixtion,<br/>
Which is by Nature and elements tempered so well,<br/>
That he delights as gold in the fire to dwell.<br/>
For to the creatures of the fire and his region,<br/>
The fire is always most natural.<br/>
For that in their commixture it is most predominate,<br/>
Which maketh them the more able the fire to endure,<br/>
By reason of much heat and dryness in their temperature.<br/>
The water to the fire is most enemy.<br/>
Therefore, keep fire in water, and moisten that which is dry,<br/>
And it will perish and die, and soon putrefy.<br/>
For as the fire is hot of himself, and of the earth dry,<br/>
So the water is cold and moist of the sky,<br/>
Which causes creatures of the fire to die and putrefy.<br/>
For cold doth destroy and moist doth putrefy,<br/>
Except you know this, study not philosophy.

Likewise, the creatures that in the air do live,<br/>
Of the airy substance are most compact.<br/>
The other elements which do under drive,<br/>
As water, earth and fire, of which they are facte (made).<br/>
Yet in the air they most delight, and of it do feed,<br/>
And in their contrary full ill do they speed.<br/>
For it is omne oppositum under the sky,<br/>
Which is the only cause all creatures do die.<br/>
For in their simile all things do rejoice,<br/>
And of their simile they all ways make choice.

And creatures engendered in the waters cold and moist,<br/>
Are sluggish and heavy, are given to much rest,<br/>
And feed of such things as that Element doth hold.<br/>
For their bodies are gross and of a moist mould,<br/>
As fishes, frogs and herbs: milk, butter and cheese,<br/>
To feed so grossly, they are nothing greasy.
