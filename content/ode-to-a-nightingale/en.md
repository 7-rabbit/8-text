<h1>Ode to a Nightingale</h1>
<cite>John Keats</cite>
<p>
My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains<br/>
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,<br/>
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains<br/>
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:<br/>
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,<br/>
But being too happy in thine happiness,<br/>
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,<br/>
In some melodious plot<br/>
Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,<br/>
Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
</p>
<p>
O for a draught of vintage! that hath been<br/>
Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,<br/>
Tasting of Flora and the country-green,<br/>
Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!<br/>
O for a beaker full of the warm South!<br/>
Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,<br/>
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,<br/>
And purple-stained mouth;<br/>
That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,<br/>
And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
</p>
<p>
Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget<br/>
What thou among the leaves hast never known,<br/>
The weariness, the fever, and the fret<br/>
Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;<br/>
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last grey hairs,<br/>
Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;<br/>
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow<br/>
And leaden-eyed despairs;<br/>
Where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,<br/>
Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
Away! away! for I will fly to thee,<br/>
Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,<br/>
But on the viewless wings of Poesy,<br/>
Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:<br/>
Already with thee! tender is the night,<br/>
And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,<br/>
Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays<br/>
But here there is no light,<br/>
Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown<br/>
Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
</p>
<p>
I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,<br/>
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,<br/>
But, in embalmèd darkness, guess each sweet<br/>
Wherewith the seasonable month endows<br/>
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;<br/>
White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;<br/>
Fast-fading violets cover'd up in leaves;<br/>
And mid-May's eldest child,<br/>
The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,<br/>
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
</p>
<p>
Darkling I listen; and, for many a time<br/>
I have been half in love with easeful Death,<br/>
Call'd him soft names in many a musèd rhyme,<br/>
To take into the air my quiet breath;<br/>
Now more than ever seems it rich to die,<br/>
To cease upon the midnight with no pain,<br/>
While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad<br/>
In such an ecstasy!<br/>
Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—<br/>
To thy high requiem become a sod.
</p>
<p>
Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!<br/>
No hungry generations tread thee down;<br/>
The voice I hear this passing night was heard<br/>
In ancient days by emperor and clown:<br/>
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path<br/>
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,<br/>
She stood in tears amid the alien corn;<br/>
The same that ofttimes hath<br/>
Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam<br/>
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
</p>
<p>
Forlorn! the very word is like a bell<br/>
To toll me back from thee to my sole self!<br/>
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well<br/>
As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.<br/>
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades<br/>
Past the near meadows, over the still stream,<br/>
Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep<br/>
In the next valley-glades:<br/>
Was it a vision, or a waking dream?<br/>
Fled is that music:—do I wake or sleep?<br/>
</p>
