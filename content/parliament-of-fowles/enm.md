<h1>The Parliament of Fowles</h1>

The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne,<br/>
Thassay so hard, so sharp the conquering,<br/>
The dredful Ioy, that alwey slit so yerne,<br/>
Al this mene I by love, that my feling<br/>
Astonyeth with his wonderful worching<br/>
So sore y-wis, that whan I on him thinke,<br/>
Nat wot I wel wher that I wake or winke.

For al be that I knowe nat love in dede,<br/>
Ne wot how that he quyteth folk hir hyre,<br/>
Yet happeth me ful ofte in bokes rede<br/>
Of his miracles, and his cruel yre;<br/>
Ther rede I wel he wol be lord and syre,<br/>
I dar not seyn, his strokes been so sore,<br/>
But God save swich a lord! I can no more.

Of usage, what for luste what for lore,<br/>
On bokes rede I ofte, as I yow tolde.<br/>
But wherfor that I speke al this? not yore<br/>
Agon, hit happed me for to beholde<br/>
Upon a boke, was write with lettres olde;<br/>
And ther-upon, a certeyn thing to lerne,<br/>
The longe day ful faste I radde and yerne.

For out of olde feldes, as men seith,<br/>
Cometh al this newe corn fro yeer to yere;<br/>
And out of olde bokes, in good feith,<br/>
Cometh al this newe science that men lere.<br/>
But now to purpos as of this matere –<br/>
To rede forth hit gan me so delyte,<br/>
That al the day me thoughte but a lyte.

This book of which I make of mencioun,<br/>
Entitled was al thus, as I shal telle,<br/>
'Tullius of the dreme of Scipioun.';<br/>
Chapitres seven hit hadde, of hevene and helle,<br/>
And erthe, and soules that therinnr dwelle,<br/>
Of whiche, as shortly as I can hit trete,<br/>
Of his sentence I wol you seyn the grete.

First telleth hit, whan Scipion was come<br/>
In Afrik, how he mette Massinisse,<br/>
That him for Ioye in armes hath y nome.<br/>
Than telleth hit hir speche and al the blisse<br/>
That was betwix hem, til the day gan misse;<br/>
And how his auncestre, African so dere,<br/>
Gan in his slepe that night to him appere.

Than telleth hit that, fro a sterry place,<br/>
How African hath him Cartage shewed,<br/>
And warned him before of al his grace,<br/>
And seyde him, what man, lered other lewed,<br/>
That loveth comun profit, wel y-thewed,<br/>
He shal unto a blisful place wende,<br/>
Ther as Ioye is that last withouten ende.

Than asked he, if folk that heer be dede<br/>
Have lyf and dwelling in another place;<br/>
And African seyde, 'ye, withoute drede,'<br/>
And that our present worldes lyves space<br/>
Nis but a maner deth, what wey we trace,<br/>
And rightful folk shal go, after they dye,<br/>
To heven; and shewed him the galaxye.

Than shewed he him the litel erthe, that heer is,<br/>
At regard of the hevenes quantite;<br/>
And after shewed he him the nyne speres,<br/>
And after that the melodye herde he<br/>
That cometh of thilke speres thryes three,<br/>
That welle is of musyk and melodye<br/>
In this world heer, and cause of armonye.

Than bad he him, sin erthe was so lyte,<br/>
And ful of torment and of harde grace,<br/>
That he ne shulde him in the world delyte.<br/>
Than tolde he him, in certeyn yeres space,<br/>
That every sterre shulde come into his place<br/>
Ther hit was first; and al shulde out of minde<br/>
That in this worlde is don of al mankinde.

Than prayde him Scipioun to telle him al<br/>
The wey to come un-to that hevene blisse;<br/>
And he seyde, 'know thy-self first immortal,<br/>
And loke ay besily thou werke and wisse<br/>
To comun profit, and thou shalt nat misse<br/>
To comen swiftly to that place dere,<br/>
That ful of blisse is and of soules clere.

But brekers of the lawe, soth to seyne,<br/>
And lecherous folk, after that they be dede,<br/>
Shul alwey whirle aboute therthe in peyne,<br/>
Til many a world be passed, out of drede,<br/>
And than, for-yeven alle hir wikked dede,<br/>
Than shul they come unto that blisful place,<br/>
To which to comen god thee sende his grace!' –

The day gan failen, and the derke night,<br/>
That reveth bestes from her besinesse,<br/>
Berafte me my book for lakke of light,<br/>
And to my bedde I gan me for to dresse,<br/>
Fulfild of thought and besy hevinesse;<br/>
For bothe I hadde thing which that I nolde,<br/>
And eek I ne hadde that thing that I wolde.

But fynally my spirit, at the laste,<br/>
For-wery of my labour al the day,<br/>
Took rest, that made me to slepe faste,<br/>
And in my slepe I mette, as I lay,<br/>
How African, right in the selfe aray<br/>
That Scipioun him saw before that tyde,<br/>
Was comen and stood right at my bedes syde.

The wery hunter, slepinge in his bed,<br/>
To wode ayein his minde goth anoon;<br/>
The Iuge dremeth how his plees ben sped;<br/>
The carter dremeth how his cartes goon;<br/>
The riche, of gold; the knight fight with his foon;<br/>
The seke met he drinketh of the tonne;<br/>
The lover met he hath his lady wonne.

Can I nat seyn if that the cause were<br/>
For I had red of African beforn,<br/>
That made me to mete that he stood there;<br/>
But thus seyde he, 'thou hast thee so wel born<br/>
In loking of myn olde book to-torn,<br/>
Of which Macrobie roghte nat a lyte,<br/>
That somdel of thy labour wolde I quyte!' –

Citherea! thou blisful lady swete,<br/>
That with thy fyr-brand dauntest whom thee lest,<br/>
And madest me this sweven for to mete,<br/>
Be thou my help in this, for thou mayst best;<br/>
As wisly as I saw thee north-north-west,<br/>
When I began my sweven for to wryte,<br/>
So yif me might to ryme and endyte!<br/>
THE STORY<br/>
This forseid African me hente anoon,<br/>
And forth with him unto a gate broghte<br/>
Right of a parke, walled of grene stoon;<br/>
And over the gate, with lettres large y-wroghte,<br/>
Ther weren vers y-writen, as me thoghte,<br/>
On eyther halfe, of ful gret difference,<br/>
Of which I shal yow sey the pleyn sentence.

'Thorgh me men goon in-to that blisful place<br/>
Of hertes hele and dedly woundes cure;<br/>
Thorgh me men goon unto the welle of Grace,<br/>
Ther grene and lusty May shal ever endure;<br/>
This is the wey to al good aventure;<br/>
Be glad, thou reder, and thy sorwe of-caste,<br/>
Al open am I; passe in, and by the faste!'

'Thorgh me men goon,' than spak that other syde,<br/>
'Unto the mortal strokes of the spere,<br/>
Of which Disdayn and Daunger is the gyde,<br/>
Ther tre shal never fruyt ne leves bere.<br/>
This streem yow ledeth to the sorwful were,<br/>
Ther as the fish in prison is al drye;<br/>
Theschewing is only the remedye.'

Thise vers of gold and blak y-writen were,<br/>
Of whiche I gan a stounde to beholde,<br/>
For with that oon encresed ay my fere,<br/>
And with that other gan myn herte bolde;<br/>
That oon me hette, that other did me colde,<br/>
No wit had I, for errour, for to chese<br/>
To entre or flee, or me to save or lese.

Right as, betwixen adamauntes two<br/>
Of even might, a pece of iren y-set,<br/>
That hath no might to meve to ne fro –<br/>
For what that on may hale, that other let –<br/>
Ferde I; that niste whether me was bet,<br/>
To entre or leve, til African my gyde<br/>
Me hente, and shoof in at the gates wyde,

And seyde, 'hit stondeth writen in thy face,<br/>
Thyn errour, though thou telle it not to me;<br/>
But dred the nat to come in-to this place,<br/>
For this wryting is no-thing ment by thee,<br/>
Ne by noon, but he Loves servant be;<br/>
For thou of love hast lost thy tast, I gesse,<br/>
As seek man hath of swete and bitternesse.

But natheles, al-though that thou be dulle,<br/>
Yit that thou canst not do, yit mayst thou see;<br/>
For many a man that may not stonde a pulle,<br/>
Yit lyketh him at the wrastling for to be,<br/>
And demeth yit wher he do bet or he;<br/>
And if thou haddest cunning for tendyte,<br/>
I shal thee shewen mater of to wryte.'

With that my hond in his he took anoon,<br/>
Of which I comfort caughte, and went in faste;<br/>
But, lord! so I was glad and wel begoon!<br/>
For over-al, wher that I myn eyen caste,<br/>
Were trees clad with leves that ay shal laste,<br/>
Eche in his kinde, of colour fresh and grene<br/>
As emeraude, that Ioye was to sene.

The bilder ook, and eek the hardy asshe;<br/>
The piler elm, the cofre unto careyne;<br/>
The boxtree piper; holm to whippes lasshe;<br/>
The sayling firr; the cipres, deth to pleyne;<br/>
The sheter ew, the asp for shaftes pleyne;<br/>
The olyve of pees, and eek the drunken vyne,<br/>
The victor palm, the laurer to devyne.

A gardyn saw I, ful of blosmy bowes,<br/>
Upon a river, in a grene mede,<br/>
Ther as swetnesse evermore y-now is,<br/>
With floures whyte, blewe, yelowe, and rede;<br/>
And colde welle-stremes, no-thing dede,<br/>
That swommen ful of smale fisshes lighte,<br/>
With finnes rede and scales silver-brighte.

On every bough the briddes herde I singe,<br/>
With voys of aungel in hir armonye,<br/>
Som besyed hem hir briddes forth to bringe;<br/>
The litel conyes to hir pley gunne hye.<br/>
And further al aboute I gan espye<br/>
The dredful roo, the buk, the hert and hinde,<br/>
Squerels, and bestes smale of gentil kinde.

Of instruments of strenges in acord<br/>
Herde I so pleye a ravisshing swetnesse,<br/>
That god, that maker is of al and lord,<br/>
Ne herde never better, as I gesse;<br/>
Therwith a wind, unnethe hit might be lesse,<br/>
Made in the leves grene a noise softe<br/>
Acordaunt to the foules songe on-lofte.

The air of that place so attempre was<br/>
That never was grevaunce of hoot ne cold;<br/>
Ther wex eek every holsum spyce and gras,<br/>
Ne no man may ther wexe seek ne old;<br/>
Yet was ther Ioye more a thousand fold<br/>
Then man can telle; ne never wolde it nighte,<br/>
But ay cleer day to any mannes sighte.

Under a tree, besyde a welle, I say<br/>
Cupyde our lord his arwes forge and fyle;<br/>
And at his fete his bowe al redy lay,<br/>
And wel his doghter tempred al this whyle<br/>
The hedes in the welle, and with hir wyle<br/>
She couched hem after as they shulde serve,<br/>
Some for to slee, and some to wounde and kerve.

Tho was I war of Plesaunce anon-right,<br/>
And of Aray, and Lust, and Curtesye,<br/>
And of the Craft that can and hath the might<br/>
To doon by force a wight to do folye –<br/>
Disfigurat was she, I nil not lye;<br/>
And by him-self, under an oke, I gesse,<br/>
Saw I Delyt, that stood with Gentilnesse.

I saw Beautee, withouten any atyr,<br/>
And Youthe, ful of game and Iolyte,<br/>
Fool-hardinesse, Flatery, and Desyr,<br/>
Messagerye, and Mede, and other three –<br/>
Hir names shul noght here be told for me –<br/>
And upon pilers grete of Iasper longe<br/>
I saw a temple of bras y-founded stronge.

Aboute the temple daunceden alway<br/>
Wommen y-nowe, of whiche some ther were<br/>
Faire of hem-self, and somme of hem were gay;<br/>
In kirtels, al disshevele, wente they there –<br/>
That was hir office alway, yeer by yere –<br/>
And on the temple, of doves whyte and faire<br/>
Saw I sittinge many a hunderede paire.

Before the temple-dore ful soberly<br/>
Dame Pees sat, with a curteyn in hir hond:<br/>
And hir besyde, wonder discretly,<br/>
Dame Pacience sitting ther I fond<br/>
With face pale, upon an hille of sond;<br/>
And alder-next, within and eek with-oute,<br/>
Behest and Art, and of hir folke a route.

Within the temple, of syghes hote as fyr<br/>
I herde a swogh that gan aboute renne;<br/>
Which syghes were engendred with desyr,<br/>
That maden every auter for to brenne<br/>
Of newe flaume; and wel aspyed I thenne<br/>
That al the cause of sorwes that they drye<br/>
Com of the bitter goddesse Ialousye.

The god Priapus saw I, as I wente,<br/>
Within the temple, in soverayn place stonde,<br/>
In swich aray as whan the asse him shente<br/>
With crye by night, and with ceptre in honde;<br/>
Ful besily men gunne assaye and fonde<br/>
Upon his hede to sette, of sondry hewe,<br/>
Garlondes ful of fresshe floures newe.

And in a privee corner, in disporte,<br/>
Fond I Venus and hir porter Richesse,<br/>
That was ful noble and hauteyn of hir porte;<br/>
Derk was that place, but afterward lightnesse<br/>
I saw a lyte, unnethe hit might be lesse,<br/>
And on a bed of golde she lay to reste,<br/>
Til that the hote sonne gan to weste.

Hir gilte heres with a golden threde<br/>
Y-bounden were, untressed as she lay,<br/>
And naked fro the breste unto the hede<br/>
Men might hir see; and, sothly for to say,<br/>
The remenant wel kevered to my pay<br/>
Right with a subtil kerchef of Valence,<br/>
Ther was no thikker cloth of no defence.

The place yaf a thousand savours swote,<br/>
And Bachus, god of wyn, sat hir besyde,<br/>
And Ceres next, that doth of hunger bote;<br/>
And, as I seide, amiddes lay Cipryde,<br/>
To whom on knees two yonge folkes cryde<br/>
To ben hir help; but thus I leet hir lye,<br/>
And ferther in the temple I gan espye

That, in dispyte of Diane the chaste,<br/>
Ful many a bowe y-broke heng on the wal<br/>
Of maydens, suche as gunne hir tymes waste<br/>
In hir servyse; and peynted over al<br/>
Of many a story, of which I touche shal<br/>
A fewe, as of Calixte and Athalaunte,<br/>
And many a mayde, of which the name I wante;

Semyramus, Candace, and Ercules,<br/>
Biblis, Dido, Thisbe, and Piramus,<br/>
Tristram, Isoude, Paris, and Achilles,<br/>
Eleyne, Cleopatre, and Troilus,<br/>
Silla, and eek the moder of Romulus –<br/>
Alle these were peynted on that other syde,<br/>
And al hir love, and in what plyte they dyde.

Whan I was come ayen unto the place<br/>
That I of spak, that was so swote and grene,<br/>
Forth welk I tho, my-selven to solace.<br/>
Tho was I war wher that ther sat a quene<br/>
That, as of light the somer-sonne shene<br/>
Passeth the sterre, right so over mesure<br/>
She fairer was than any creature.

And in a launde, upon an hille of floures,<br/>
Was set this noble goddesse Nature;<br/>
Of braunches were hir halles and hir boures,<br/>
Y-wrought after hir craft and hir mesure;<br/>
Ne ther nas foul that cometh of engendrure,<br/>
That they ne were prest in hir presence,<br/>
To take hir doom and yeve hir audience.

For this was on seynt Valentynes day,<br/>
Whan every foul cometh ther to chese his make,<br/>
Of every kinde, that men thenke may;<br/>
And that so huge a noyse gan they make,<br/>
That erthe and see, and tree, and every lake<br/>
So ful was, that unnethe was ther space<br/>
For me to stonde, so ful was al the place.

And right as Aleyn, in the Pleynt of Kinde,<br/>
Devyseth Nature of aray and face,<br/>
In swich aray men mighten hir ther finde.<br/>
This noble emperesse, ful of grace,<br/>
Bad every foul to take his owne place,<br/>
As they were wont alwey fro yeer to yere,<br/>
Seynt Valentynes day, to stonden there.

That is to sey, the foules of ravyne<br/>
Were hyest set; and than the foules smale,<br/>
That eten as hem nature wolde enclyne,<br/>
As worm or thing of whiche I telle no tale;<br/>
And water-foul sat loweste in the dale;<br/>
But foul that liveth by seed sat on the grene,<br/>
And that so fele, that wonder was to sene.

There mighte men the royal egle finde,<br/>
That with his sharpe look perceth the sonne;<br/>
And other egles of a lower kinde,<br/>
Of which that clerkes wel devysen conne.<br/>
Ther was the tyraunt with his fethres done<br/>
And greye, I mene the goshauk, that doth pyne<br/>
To briddes for his outrageous ravyne.

The gentil faucoun, that with his feet distreyneth<br/>
The kinges hond; the hardy sperhauk eke,<br/>
The quayles foo; the merlion that payneth<br/>
Him-self ful ofte, the larke for to seke;<br/>
Ther was the douve, with hir eyen meke;<br/>
The Ialous swan, ayens his deth that singeth;<br/>
The oule eek, that of dethe the bode bringeth;

The crane the geaunt, with his trompes soune;<br/>
The theef, the chogh; and eek the Iangling pye;<br/>
The scorning Iay; the eles foo, heroune;<br/>
The false lapwing, ful of trecherye;<br/>
The stare, that the counseyl can bewrye;<br/>
The tame ruddok; and the coward kyte;<br/>
The cok, that orloge is of thorpes lyte;

The sparow, Venus sone; the nightingale,<br/>
That clepeth forth the fresshe leves newe;<br/>
The swalow, mordrer of the flyes smale<br/>
That maken hony of floures fresshe of hewe;<br/>
The wedded turtel, with hir herte trewe;<br/>
The pecok, with his aungels fethres brighte;<br/>
The fesaunt, scorner of the cok by nighte;

The waker goos; the cukkow ever unkinde;<br/>
The popiniay, ful of delicasye;<br/>
The drake, stroyer of his owne kinde;<br/>
The stork, the wreker of avouterye;<br/>
The hote cormeraunt of glotonye;<br/>
The raven wys, the crow with vois of care;<br/>
The throstel olde; the frosty feldefare.

What shulde I seyn? of foules every kinde<br/>
That in this world han fethres and stature,<br/>
Men mighten in that place assembled finde<br/>
Before the noble goddesse Nature,<br/>
And everich of hem did his besy cure<br/>
Benignely to chese or for to take,<br/>
By hir acord, his formel or his make.

But to the poynt – Nature held on hir honde<br/>
A formel egle, of shap the gentileste<br/>
That ever she among hir werkes fonde,<br/>
The moste benigne and the goodlieste;<br/>
In hir was every vertu at his reste,<br/>
So ferforth, that Nature hir-self had blisse<br/>
To loke on hir, and ofte hir bek to kisse.

Nature, the vicaire of thalmighty lorde,<br/>
That hoot, cold, hevy, light, and moist and dreye<br/>
Hath knit by even noumbre of acorde,<br/>
In esy vois began to speke and seye,<br/>
'Foules, tak hede of my sentence, I preye,<br/>
And, for your ese, in furthering of your nede,<br/>
As faste as I may speke, I wol me spede.

Ye knowe wel how, seynt Valentynes day,<br/>
By my statut and through my governaunce,<br/>
Ye come for to chese – and flee your way –<br/>
Your makes, as I prik yow with plesaunce.<br/>
But natheles, my rightful ordenaunce<br/>
May I not lete, for al this world to winne,<br/>
That he that most is worthy shal beginne.

The tercel egle, as that ye knowen wel,<br/>
The foul royal above yow in degree,<br/>
The wyse and worthy, secree, trewe as stel,<br/>
The which I formed have, as ye may see,<br/>
In every part as hit best lyketh me,<br/>
Hit nedeth noght his shap yow to devyse,<br/>
He shal first chese and speken in his gyse.

And after him, by order shul ye chese,<br/>
After your kinde, everich as yow lyketh,<br/>
And, as your hap is, shul ye winne or lese;<br/>
But which of yow that love most entryketh,<br/>
God sende him hir that sorest for him syketh.'<br/>
And therwith-al the tercel gan she calle,<br/>
And seyde, 'my sone, the choys is to thee falle.

But natheles, in this condicioun<br/>
Mot be the choys of everich that is here,<br/>
That she agree to his eleccioun,<br/>
What-so he be that shulde be hir fere;<br/>
This is our usage alwey, fro yeer to yere;<br/>
And who so may at this time have his grace,<br/>
In blisful tyme he com in-to this place.'

With hed enclyned and with ful humble chere<br/>
This royal tercel spak and taried nought:<br/>
'Unto my sovereyn lady, and noght my fere,<br/>
I chese, and chese with wille and herte and thought,<br/>
The formel on your hond so wel y-wrought,<br/>
Whos I am al and ever wol hir serve,<br/>
Do what hir list, to do me live or sterve.

Beseching hir of mercy and of grace,<br/>
As she that is my lady sovereyne;<br/>
Or let me dye present in this place.<br/>
For certes, long may I not live in peyne;<br/>
For in myn herte is corven every veyne;<br/>
Having reward only to my trouthe,<br/>
My dere herte, have on my wo som routhe.

And if that I to hir be founde untrewe,<br/>
Disobeysaunt, or wilful negligent,<br/>
Avauntour, or in proces love a newe,<br/>
I pray to you this be my Iugement,<br/>
That with these foules I be al to-rent,<br/>
That ilke day that ever she me finde<br/>
To hir untrewe, or in my gilte unkinde.

And sin that noon loveth hir so wel as I,<br/>
Al be she never of love me behette,<br/>
Than oghte she be myn thourgh hir mercy,<br/>
For other bond can I noon on hir knette.<br/>
For never, for no wo, ne shal I lette<br/>
To serven hir, how fer so that she wende;<br/>
Sey what yow list, my tale is at an ende.'

Right as the fresshe, rede rose newe<br/>
Ayen the somer-sonne coloured is,<br/>
Right so for shame al wexen gan the hewe<br/>
Of this formel, whan she herde al this;<br/>
She neyther answerde 'Wel', ne seyde amis,<br/>
So sore abasshed was she, til that Nature<br/>
Seyde, 'doghter, drede yow noght, I yow assure.'

Another tercel egle spak anoon<br/>
Of lower kinde, and seyde, 'that shal nat be;<br/>
I love hir bet than ye do, by seynt Iohn,<br/>
Or atte leste I love hir as wel as ye;<br/>
And lenger have served hir, in my degree,<br/>
And if she shulde have loved for long loving,<br/>
To me allone had been the guerdoninge.

I dar eek seye, if she me finde fals,<br/>
Unkinde, Iangler, or rebel in any wyse,<br/>
Or Ialous, do me hongen by the hals!<br/>
And but I bere me in hir servyse<br/>
As wel as that my wit can me suffyse,<br/>
From poynt to poynt, hir honour for to save,<br/>
Tak she my lyf, and al the good I have.'

The thridde tercel egle answerde tho,<br/>
'Now, sirs, ye seen the litel leyser here;<br/>
For every foul cryeth out to been a-go<br/>
Forth with his make, or with his lady dere;<br/>
And eek Nature hir-self ne wol nought here,<br/>
For tarying here, noght half that I wolde seye;<br/>
And but I speke, I mot for sorwe deye.

Of long servyse avaunte I me no-thing,<br/>
But as possible is me to dye to-day<br/>
For wo, as he that hath ben languisshing<br/>
Thise twenty winter, and wel happen may<br/>
A man may serven bet and more to pay<br/>
In half a yere, al-though hit were no more,<br/>
Than som man doth that hath served ful yore.

I ne sey not this by me, for I ne can<br/>
Do no servyse that may my lady plese;<br/>
But I dar seyn, I am hir trewest man<br/>
As to my dome, and feynest wolde hir ese;<br/>
At shorte wordes, til that deth me sese,<br/>
I wol ben hires, whether I wake or winke,<br/>
And trewe in al that herte may bethinke.'

Of al my lyf, sin that day I was born,<br/>
So gentil plee in love or other thing<br/>
Ne herde never no man me beforn,<br/>
Who-so that hadde leyser and cunning<br/>
For to reherse hir chere and hir speking;<br/>
And from the morwe gan this speche laste<br/>
Til dounward drow the sonne wonder faste.

The noyse of foules for to ben delivered<br/>
So loude rong, 'have doon and let us wende!'<br/>
That wel wende I the wode had al to-shivered.<br/>
'Come of!' they cryde, 'allas! ye wil us shende!<br/>
Whan shal your cursed pleding have an ende?<br/>
How shulde a Iuge eyther party leve,<br/>
For yee or nay, with-outen any preve?'

The goos, the cokkow, and the doke also<br/>
So cryden, 'kek, kek!' 'kukkow!' 'quek, quek!' hye,<br/>
That thorgh myn eres the noyse wente tho.<br/>
The goos seyde, 'al this nis not worth a flye!<br/>
But I can shape hereof a remedye,<br/>
And I wol sey my verdit faire and swythe<br/>
For water-foul, who-so be wrooth or blythe.'

'And I for worm-foul,' seyde the fool cukkow,<br/>
'For I wol, of myn owne auctorite,<br/>
For comune spede, take the charge now,<br/>
For to delivere us is gret charite.'<br/>
'Ye may abyde a whyle yet, parde!'<br/>
Seide the turtel, 'if hit be your wille<br/>
A wight may speke, him were as good be stille.

I am a seed-foul, oon the unworthieste,<br/>
That wot I wel, and litel of kunninge;<br/>
But bet is that a wightes tonge reste<br/>
Than entermeten him of such doinge<br/>
Of which he neyther rede can nor singe.<br/>
And who-so doth, ful foule himself acloyeth,<br/>
For office uncommitted ofte anoyeth.'

Nature, which that alway had an ere<br/>
To murmour of the lewednes behinde,<br/>
With facound voys seide, 'hold your tonges there!<br/>
And I shal sone, I hope, a counseyl finde<br/>
You to delivere, and fro this noyse unbinde;<br/>
I Iuge, of every folk men shal oon calle<br/>
To seyn the verdit for you foules alle.'

Assented were to this conclusioun<br/>
The briddes alle; and foules of ravyne<br/>
Han chosen first, by pleyn eleccioun,<br/>
The tercelet of the faucon, to diffyne<br/>
Al hir sentence, and as him list, termyne;<br/>
And to Nature him gonnen to presente,<br/>
And she accepteth him with glad entente.

The tercelet seide than in this manere:<br/>
'Ful hard were it to preve hit by resoun<br/>
Who loveth best this gentil formel here;<br/>
For everich hath swich replicacioun,<br/>
That noon by skilles may be broght a-doun;<br/>
I can not seen that argumentes avayle;<br/>
Than semeth hit ther moste be batayle.'

'Al redy!' quod these egles tercels tho.<br/>
'Nay, sirs!' quod he, 'if that I dorste it seye,<br/>
Ye doon me wrong, my tale is not y-do!<br/>
For sirs, ne taketh noght a-gref, I preye,<br/>
It may noght gon, as ye wolde, in this weye;<br/>
Oure is the voys that han the charge in honde,<br/>
And to the Iuges dome ye moten stonde;

'And therfor, pees! I seye, as to my wit,<br/>
Me wolde thinke how that the worthieste<br/>
Of knighthode, and lengest hath used hit,<br/>
Moste of estat, of blode the gentileste,<br/>
Were sittingest for hir, if that hir leste;<br/>
And of these three she wot hir-self, I trowe,<br/>
Which that he be, for hit is light to knowe.'

The water-foules han her hedes leyd<br/>
Togeder, and of short avysement,<br/>
Whan everich had his large golee seyd,<br/>
They seyden sothly, al by oon assent,<br/>
How that 'the goos, with hir facounde gent,<br/>
That so desyreth to pronounce our nede,<br/>
Shal telle our tale,' and preyde 'god hir spede.'

And for these water-foules tho began<br/>
The goos to speke, and in hir cakelinge<br/>
She seyde, 'pees! now tak kepe every man,<br/>
And herkeneth which a reson I shal bringe;<br/>
My wit is sharp, I love no taryinge;<br/>
I seye, I rede him, though he were my brother,<br/>
But she wol love him, lat him love another!'

'Lo here! a parfit reson of a goos!'<br/>
Quod the sperhauk; 'never mot she thee!<br/>
Lo, swich hit is to have a tonge loos!<br/>
Now parde, fool, yet were hit bet for thee<br/>
Have holde thy pees, than shewed thy nycete!<br/>
Hit lyth not in his wit nor in his wille,<br/>
But sooth is seyd, "a fool can noght be stille."'

The laughter aroos of gentil foules alle,<br/>
And right anoon the seed-foul chosen hadde<br/>
The turtel trewe, and gunne hir to hem calle,<br/>
And preyden hir to seye the sothe sadde<br/>
Of this matere, and asked what she radde;<br/>
And she answerde, that pleynly hir entente<br/>
She wolde shewe, and sothly what she mente.

'Nay, god forbede a lover shulde chaunge!'<br/>
The turtle seyde, and wex for shame al reed;<br/>
'Thogh that his lady ever-more be straunge,<br/>
Yet let him serve hir ever, til he be deed;<br/>
For sothe, I preyse noght the gooses reed;<br/>
For thogh she deyed, I wolde non other make,<br/>
I wol ben hires, til that the deth me take.'

'Wel bourded!' quod the doke, 'by my hat!<br/>
That men shulde alwey loven, causeles,<br/>
Who can a reson finde or wit in that?<br/>
Daunceth he mury that is mirtheles?<br/>
Who shulde recche of that is reccheles?<br/>
Ye, quek!' yit quod the doke, ful wel and faire,<br/>
'There been mo sterres, god wot, than a paire!'

'Now fy, cherl!' quod the gentil tercelet,<br/>
'Out of the dunghil com that word ful right,<br/>
Thou canst noght see which thing is wel be-set:<br/>
Thou farest by love as oules doon by light,<br/>
The day hem blent, ful wel they see by night;<br/>
Thy kind is of so lowe a wrechednesse,<br/>
That what love is, thou canst nat see ne gesse.'

Tho gan the cukkow putte him forth in prees<br/>
For foul that eteth worm, and seide blyve,<br/>
'So I,' quod he, 'may have my make in pees,<br/>
I recche not how longe that ye stryve;<br/>
Lat ech of hem be soleyn al hir lyve,<br/>
This is my reed, sin they may not acorde;<br/>
This shorte lesson nedeth noght recorde.'

'Ye! have the glotoun fild ynogh his paunche,<br/>
Than are we wel!' seyde the merlioun;<br/>
'Thou mordrer of the heysugge on the braunche<br/>
That broghte thee forth, thou rewthelees glotoun!<br/>
Live thou soleyn, wormes corrupcioun!<br/>
For no fors is of lakke of thy nature;<br/>
Go, lewed be thou, whyl the world may dure!'

'Now pees,' quod Nature, 'I comaunde here;<br/>
For I have herd al your opinioun,<br/>
And in effect yet be we never the nere;<br/>
But fynally, this is my conclusioun,<br/>
That she hir-self shal han the eleccioun<br/>
Of whom hir list, who-so be wrooth or blythe,<br/>
Him that she cheest, he shal hir have as swythe.

For sith hit may not here discussed be<br/>
Who loveth hir best, as seide the tercelet,<br/>
Than wol I doon hir this favour, that she<br/>
Shal have right him on whom hir herte is set,<br/>
And he hir that his herte hath on hir knet.<br/>
Thus Iuge I, Nature, for I may not lye;<br/>
To noon estat I have non other ye.

But as for counseyl for to chese a make,<br/>
If hit were reson, certes, than wolde I<br/>
Counseyle yow the royal tercel take,<br/>
As seide the tercelet ful skilfully,<br/>
As for the gentilest and most worthy,<br/>
Which I have wroght so wel to my plesaunce;<br/>
That to yow oghte been a suffisaunce.'

With dredful vois the formel hir answerde,<br/>
'My rightful lady, goddesse of Nature,<br/>
Soth is that I am ever under your yerde,<br/>
Lyk as is everiche other creature,<br/>
And moot be youres whyl that my lyf may dure;<br/>
And therfor graunteth me my firste bone,<br/>
And myn entente I wol yow sey right sone.'

'I graunte it you,' quod she; and right anoon<br/>
This formel egle spak in this degree,<br/>
'Almighty quene, unto this yeer be doon<br/>
I aske respit for to avysen me.<br/>
And after that to have my choys al free;<br/>
This al and sum, that I wolde speke and seye;<br/>
Ye gete no more, al-though ye do me deye.

I wol noght serven Venus ne Cupyde<br/>
For sothe as yet, by no manere wey.'<br/>
'Now sin it may non other wyse betyde,'<br/>
Quod tho Nature, 'here is no more to sey;<br/>
Than wolde I that these foules were a-wey<br/>
Ech with his make, for tarying lenger here' –<br/>
And seyde hem thus, as ye shul after here.

'To you speke I, ye tercelets,' quod Nature,<br/>
'Beth of good herte and serveth, alle three;<br/>
A yeer is not so longe to endure,<br/>
And ech of yow peyne him, in his degree,<br/>
For to do wel; for, god wot, quit is she<br/>
Fro yow this yeer; what after so befalle,<br/>
This entremes is dressed for you alle.'

And whan this werk al broght was to an ende,<br/>
To every foule Nature yaf his make<br/>
By even acorde, and on hir wey they wende.<br/>
A! lord! the blisse and Ioye that they make!<br/>
For ech of hem gan other in winges take,<br/>
And with hir nekkes ech gan other winde,<br/>
Thanking alwey the noble goddesse of kinde.

But first were chosen foules for to singe,<br/>
As yeer by yere was alwey hir usaunce<br/>
To singe a roundel at hir departinge,<br/>
To do to Nature honour and plesaunce.<br/>
The note, I trowe, maked was in Fraunce;<br/>
The wordes wer swich as ye may heer finde,<br/>
The nexte vers, as I now have in minde.

Qui bien aime a tard oublie.

'Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,<br/>
That hast this wintres weders over-shake,<br/>
And driven awey the longe nightes blake!

'Saynt Valentyn, that art ful by on-lofte; –<br/>
Thus singen smale foules for thy sake –<br/>
Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,<br/>
That hast this wintres weders over-shake.

'Wel han they cause for to gladen ofte,<br/>
Sith ech of hem recovered hath his make;<br/>
Ful blisful may they singen whan they wake;<br/>
Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,<br/>
That hast this wintres weders over-shake,<br/>
And driven away the longe nightes blake.'

And with the showting, whan hir song was do,<br/>
That foules maden at hir flight a-way,<br/>
I wook, and other bokes took me to<br/>
To rede upon, and yet I rede alway;<br/>
In hope, y-wis, to rede so som day<br/>
That I shal mete som thing for to fare<br/>
The bet; and thus to rede I nil not spare.<br/>
