“Speak surely therefore the our names.

“Chib'ij na k'ut ri qa b'i'.

Framer,

Tz'aqol,

The original manuscript of the Popol Vuh has caharizah. The context seems to indicate that the word should be q'ijarisaj (to
worship), a word which appears in similar contexts elsewhere in the manuscript. This is apparently an instance of scribal error, or perhaps
an archaic spelling of the word which has since fallen out of usage.

The manuscript reads quicha, which is grammatically impossible for an intransitive verb.

---

B'itol,

She Who Has Borne Children,
He Who Has Begotten Sons.’

Alom,
K'ajolom.’

Speak!
Call upon us!
Worship us!” they were told.

Kixch'awoq!

Kojiq'ijila'!” xe'uchaxik.

Not therefore they succeeded,
They spoke not like then people.

Ma k'u xutzinik,

Xa kewech'elajik,
Xa kek'aralajik,
Xa kewojonik.

Merely they squawk,
Merely they chatter,
Merely they roar.

Not appeared its face their speech
Mawi xwachinik u wach ki ch'ab'al.
Differently they cried out to each other when they heard it, Jalajoj xkoq'ib'ej chi ki jujunal ta xkita,

The Framer,
Shaper:
“Not it came out well
They spoke,”
They said then to each other:
“Not it came out well
Its speaking our names by them.
We their Framer,
We also their Shaper,

Ri Tz'aqol,
B'itol:
“Mawi mi xutzinik
Mi xech'awik,”
Xecha' chik chi kib'il kib':
“Mawi mi xutzin
U b'ixik qa b'i' rumal.
Oj Kaj Tz'aq,
Oj pu Kaj B'it,

Not good,” they said then to each other,
The She Who Has Borne Children,
He Who Has Begotten Sons.
They were told therefore:

Mawi utz,” xcha' chik chi kib'il kib',
Ri Alom,
K'ajolom.
Xe'uchax k'ut:

This triplet parallels in a negative way the triplet of lines -. The newly-created animals were commanded to speak, but
instead they merely squawked; they were commanded to call upon the gods, but they merely chattered; they were commanded to worship
the gods, but they merely roared.

The manuscript reads quevachelahic, likely a scribal error for quevechelahic. According to Coto, -wech'el is to “squawk, screech, or
make the sounds of a large bird such as a hawk.” Mondloch notes that in current K'iche' usage, wech'om tzij is distorted or unintelligible
speech (personal communication).

This is an unusual arrangement of parallel couplets into a chiastic form, rather than individual ideas. An even longer example may
be seen in lines -. Considering the authors’ fondness for parallel couplets as well as chiasms, I find it odd that there aren't more
examples of this type of arrangement in the text.

---
Because not succeeded,
Not you spoke.
Therefore we changed our word.

“Xa kixjalatajik
Rumal mawi mi xutzinik,
Mawi mi xixch'awik.
Mi k'u xqajal qa tzij.

Iwecha',

Because not was successful our being worshiped,

Yet there is,
There is perhaps,

Honorer we will make now,

Q'ijilonel,

Merely you will receive your service.
Merely your flesh will be chewed.
Then be it so.
This therefore you will serve,”

Xa chik'am i patan.

They were told.
When they were commanded,

Xe'uchaxik.
Ta xepixab'axik,

Small animals,
Large animals that are upon its face earth.

Ch'uti chikop,
Nima chikop k'o chuwach ulew.

Then they wanted therefore to try again their day,

Ta xraj k'u kitij chik ki q'ij,

This triplet appears to be antithetical to the triplet which immediately follows it. The reasoning is that “they wanted to try again
their day (their luck) but they didn't hear their speech among them. They wanted to make an attempt again, but it wasn't comprehended.
They wanted to arrange again [their] worship, but it wasn't made to be as well.”

---
They wanted also to arrange again worship.

Xraj kitijitob'ej chik,
Xraj pu kinuk' chik q'ijilab'al.

It wasn't heard their speech to each other,
It wasn't successful therefore,
It wasn't made to be as well.

Xma xkita wi ki ch'ab'al chi kib'il kib',

Thus was defeated their flesh,

The manuscript seems to read cu (therefore), although Ximénez often writes a and u in a similar way. Mondloch notes that for
grammatic reasons this line should read ca tiha (let us try), which matches the construction in line  (personal communication).

Not would it look about.

“Qa wachlab'eq,

Then they undid it therefore,
They toppled it again

Mondloch associates the qui of the manuscript with qi (truly). In current K'iche' usage this would be qas.

In this context, ta(j) is used as a desiderative (Mondloch, personal communication).

Merely shall it be discovered the tree to be carved,
To be chiseled out as well

Xa chuk'ulu ri che' chajawaxik,

By Framer,
Shaper.

Kumal Aj Tz'aq,
Aj B'it.

If this provider,
Sustainer,

We are' tzuqul,
Q'o'l,

Then may it be sown,
Then may it dawn.

Ta chawaxoq,
Ta saqiroq.

You grains of maize,
You tz'ite,

At ixim,
At tz'ite,

You days,
You shaping.

At q'ij,
At b'it.

You are called,
You are summoned,”

Katchokonik,
Kattaqentaj,”

It was said to grains of maize,
Tz'ite,

Xcha' chire ixim,
Tz'ite,

Days,
Shaping.

Q'ij,
B'it.

“Finish it hither,
You its Heart Sky.

“Katk'ix la uloq,
At u K'u'x Kaj.

Don't grind up his mouth,
His face

Mak'ajisaj u chi',
U wach

Sovereign,
Quetzal Serpent,”

Tepew,
Q'ukumatz,”

They said.
Then they spoke therefore its straightness:

Xecha'.
Ta xkib'ij k'ut u suk'ulikil:

---
Carved wood.

“Utz are' chuxik ri i poy
Ajam che'.

It will speak,
It will talk then it upon its face earth.

Chich'awik,
Chitzijon b'a la' chuwach ulew.

Then be it so,” they said therefore.
Then they spoke

Ta chuxoq,” xecha' k'ut.
Ta xkib'ij.

Straightaway were made effigies,
Carved wood.

Ju suk' xb'anik poy,
Ajam che'.

Like people in appearance,
Like people in speech as well.

Xe winaq wachinik,
Xe winaq tzijonik puch.

This population
Its face earth.

Are' winaqil
U wach ulew.

They came to be,
They multiplied.

Xe'uxik,
Xepoq'ik,

They had daughters,
They had sons.

Xeme'alanik,
Xek'ajolanik.

The effigies,
Carved wood.

Ri poy,
Ajam che'.

Not therefore there was their hearts,
Not also there was their thoughts.

Ma k'u ja b'i ki k'u'x,
Ma pu ja b'i ki na'oj.

Not remembered their Framer,
Their Shaper.
Without purpose they walked,
They crawled on their hands and knees.
Not they remembered then the its Heart Sky.

Mawi na'tal Kaj Tz'aq,
Kaj B'it.
Xaloq' xeb'inik,
Xechakanik.
Mawi xkina'taj chik ri u K'u'x Kaj.

Thus they were weighed then.

Keje' k'ut xepaj chi wi.

Merely its experimentation,
Merely also its demonstration of people.

Xa u tijtob'exik,
Xa pu u wab'ab'exik chi winaq.

The stark finality of this sentence is further emphasized by the fact that it is not paired with a parallel phrase.

---
Merely dry their faces.

Kech'aw nab'ek,
Xa chaqi'j ki wach.

Not surely filled out their legs,
Their arms.

Ma na sonol kaqan,
Ki q'ab'.

There is not their blood,
Their blood flow.

Maja b'i ki kik'el,
Ki komajil.

There is not their sweat,
Their oil.

Maja b'i ki tiqowal,
Ki kab'chiyal.

Dry cheeks,
Masks their faces.

Chaqi'j q'o'tz,
K'oj ki wach.

They are stiff their legs,
Their arms.

Kapichipoj kaqan,
Ki q'ab'.

Rigid their bodies,
Thus not they capable of understanding now

Kayeyoj ki tio'jil,
Keje' k'ut mawi xena'w chi wi

Before his face Framer,
Shaper,

Chuwach Tz'aqol,
B'itol,

Givers of birth to them,
Givers of heart to them.

Alay kech,
K'u'xlay kech.

They first crowded with people,
They came to be here upon its face earth.

E nab'e tzatz chi winaq,
Xe'uxik waral chuwach ulew.

THEN therefore their end then,
Their ruin,
Their crushing as well,
They were killed then,

K'ATE k'ut ki k'isik chik,
Ki ma'ixik,
Ki k'utuxik puch,
Xekamisax chik,

Effigies,
Carved wood.

Poy,
Ajam che'.

Then was planned their flood by its Heart Sky.
Great flood was made, it came upon their heads,

Ta xna'ojix ki b'utik rumal u K'u'x Kaj.
Nima b'utik xb'anik, xpe pa ki wi',

The effigies,

Ri e poy,

Tz'ite his body the man
When he was carved

By Framer,
Shaper.

Rumal Tz'aqol,

Reeds therefore

Desired to enter by Framer,
Shaper.

Xraj okik rumal Tz'aqol,

Not they understood,
Not also they spoke

Mawi xena'wik,
Ma pu xech'awik

Before his face their Framer,
Their Shaper,

Chuwach Kaj Tz'aq,
Kaj B'it,

Maker of them,
Creator of them.

B'anol ke,
Winaqirisay kech.

Thus their being killed,
They were flooded.

Keje' k'ut ki kamisaxik,
Xeb'utik.

It came great pine resin
There from sky.

Xpe nima q'ol
Chila' chi kaj.

They came Chiselers of Faces their name,
They chiseled out its seeds their faces [eyes].

Xe[pe] K'otk'o[l] Wach u b'i'
Xk'otin uloq u b'aq' ki wach.

They came Death Knives,
They cut off their heads.

Xepe Kama Lotz,
Xqupin ula ki jolom.

He came Crouching Jaguar,
He ate their flesh.

Xpe Kotz' B'alam,
Xti'ow ki tio'jil.

The original manuscript reads xe cotco vach, which appears to be a scribal error. I agree with Edmonson in reading the line as
Xe[pe] K'otk'o[l] Wach, which is grammatically and contextually more consistent with the remainder of the section.

---
He struck them.

Xpe Tukum B'alam,
Xtukuwik.

They smashed their bones,
Their tendons.

Xkich'o'wik ki b'aqil,
Kib'och'il.

Ground up,
Broken to pieces

Xq'ajixik,
Xmuchu'lixik

Their bones.
Grinding up their faces,

Ki b'aqil.
K'ajisab'al ki wach,

Because there was not their understanding before her
face their mother,
Before his face as well their father,

Rumal mawi ki na'wik chuwach ki chuch,
Chuwach puch ki qajaw,

The its Heart Sky,
Huracan his name.

Ri u K'u'x Kaj,
Juraqan u b'i'.

By them was darkened its face earth.
It began darkened rain,

Kumal xq'equ'marik u wach ulew.
Xtikarik q'eqal jab',

Day rain,
Night rain.

Q'ijil jab',
Aq'ab'al jab'.

Entered hither little animals,
Great animals.

Xok ula ch'uti chikop,
Nima chikop.

They were crushed their faces by trees,
Stones.

Xq'ut ki wach rumal che',
Ab'aj.

Spoke all their maize grinders,
Their griddles,

Xch'awik ronojel ki ke'b'al,
Ki xot,

Their plates,
Their pots,

Ki laq,
Ki b'o'j,

Their dogs,
Their grinding stones,

Ki tz'i',
Ki ka',

However many things,
All crushed their faces.

Jaruj pa la',
Ronojel xq'utu ki wach.

---
You ate us,

“K'ax xib'an chiqe.
Xojiti'o,

You now therefore,
We will eat you now,”

Ix chi k'ut,
Xkixqati' chik,”

Said the their dogs,
Their turkeys to them.

Xcha' ri ki tz'i',
Kak' chikech.

This therefore the grinding stones:
“We were ground fine by you,

Are' k'u ri ka':
“Xojk'ok'onik iwumal,

This then the first our service before your faces
You when first people.

This day therefore you shall try
Our strength.

Wakamik k'ut xchitij

We shall grind you like maize,
We shall grind also your flesh,”

Xchiqake'j,
Xchiqajok' puch i tio'jil,”

Said the their grinding stones to them.
This therefore the their dogs said again when they spoke:

Xcha' ri ki ka' chike.
Are' k'u ri ki tz'i' xcha' chik ta xch'awik:

“Why because not you will give our food?
Merely we look,

“Naqi pa rumal mawi chiya' qa wa?
Xa kojmuqunik,

Merely also you throw us out hither,

Xa pu kojikuxij uloq,

---

Kojitzaq pu uloq.

Raised up thither,
Our beating with sticks by you

Yakal ub'i,

When you eat.
Only thus you spoke to us.

Ta kixwa'ik.
Xere kojiwucha'j wi.

Not we speak,
Not then therefore we received of you.

Mawi kojch'awik,
Ma ta k'u mi xojk'amik chiwe.

How not you understood?
You understood then therefore.

Jupacha mawi mi xixna'wik?
Xixna'w ta k'ut.

Behind you then therefore we were lost.
This day therefore you shall try

Chiwij ta k'ut xojsach wi.
Wakamik k'ut xchitij

Our teeth
That are in our mouths.

Qa b'aq
K'o pa qa chi'.

We shall eat you,”
They said the dogs to them.

Xkixqati'o,”
Xecha' ri tz'i' chike.

Then were crushed their faces.

Ta xq'ut ki wach.

This now therefore the their griddles,
Their pots, spoke again to them:

Are' chi k'u ri ki xot,
Ki b'o'j, xch'aw chik chike:

“Pain this
You did to us.

“K'ax wa'
Xib'an chiqe.

Sooty our mouths,
Sooty our faces.

Xaq qa chi',
Xaq qa wach.

Always we are thrown on its top fire.
You burn us.
Not pain we felt, you shall try it therefore.
We shall burn you,” said the their pots.

Amaq'el oj tzaqal chuwi' q'aq'.
Kojik'ato.
Mawi k'ax xqana'o, xchitij k'ut.
Xkixqaporoj,” xcha' ri ki b'o'j.

All of them,
Were crushed their faces.

Ronojel,
Xq'utu ki wach.

These the stones,

Are' ri ab'aj,

---

Ri ki xk'ub',

Would flatten them,
Would come from fire,

Chitaninik,
Chipe pa q'aq',

Landed on their heads,
Pain was done to them.

Taqal chi ki jolom,
K'ax xb'an chike.

They flee,
They hurry away now.

Anilab'ik,
Kemalmalijab' chik.

They want to climb up on its top houses,
Merely would fall apart houses, they are thrown off.

Keraj aq'anik chuwi' ja,
Xa chiwulij ja, ketzaq uloq.

They want to climb up on its top trees,
They are not supported hither by trees.

Keraj aq'an chuwi' che',
Kech'akix uloq ruma che'.

They want to enter in caves,
Merely would close up caves before their faces.

Keraj ok pa jul,
Xa chiyuch jul chikiwach.

Thus their undoing people framed,
People shaped.

Keje' k'ut u kayojik winaq tz'aq,
Winaq b'it.

They demolished,
They overthrown as people.

E tzixel,
E tzalatzoxel chi winaq.

They were ruined,
They were crushed

Xma'ixik,
Xq'utuxik

Their mouths,
Their faces all of them.

Ki chi',
Ki wach konojel.

Said therefore these their descendents,
The spider monkeys
That are in forest today,
These were their descendents.

Xcha' k'ut are' retal,
Ri k'oy
K'o pa k'eche'laj wakamik,
Are' xk'oje' wi retal.

Because merely wood
Their flesh was placed

Rumal xa che'

By Framer,
Shaper.

Rumal Aj Tz'aq,

---
Like people they would appear.

Are' k'u ri k'oy,
Keje' ri' winaq chiwachinik.

Their descendents one generation people framed,
People shaped.

Retal ju le' winaq tz'aq,
Winaq b'it.

Merely effigies,
Merely also carved wood.

Xa poy,
Xa pu ajam che'.

WHILE therefore merely a little brightened its face earth, ARE k'ut xa jub'iq' saqnatanoj u wach ulew,
There is not sun,
Maja b'i q'ij,
One therefore aggrandises himself,
Seven Macaw his name.

Jun k'ut kunimarisaj rib',
Wuqub' Kaqix u b'i'.

Existed first sky,
Earth,

K'o nab'e kaj,
Ulew,

Merely it is dim its face sun,
Moon.

Xa kamoymot u wach q'ij,
Ik'.

It is said therefore this,
Merely but its bright sign people that drowned.

Kacha' k'u ri',
Xa wi xere u saq etal winaq ri xb'utik.

Like enchanted person
His essence.

Keje' ri' nawal winaq
U k'oje'ik.

“I great,
I exist now over their heads

“In nim,
Kik'oje' chik chuwi'

People framed,
People shaped.

Winaq tz'aq,
Winaq b'it.

I their sun,
I as well their light,
I as well their moon.

In u q'ij,
In pu u saq,
In nay pu rik'il.

In contemporary K'iche' usage this would be kink'oje'. In sixteenth century K'iche', however, as well as modern Kaqchikel, the first
person singular absolutive pronoun, when functioning as the subject of intransitive verbs is -i- before consonants (Mondloch, personal
communication).

---

Ta chuxoq.

Great my brightness.
I walkway,
I as well pathway for people,
By precious metal.

Nim nu saqil.
In b'inib'al,
In pu chakab'al rumal winaq,
Rumal puwaq.

Its seeds my face merely sparkle
With glittering green/blue jewels,
As well my teeth,
Green/blue brilliant with stones,
Like its face sky.
This therefore the my beak,
Brightly shining from a distance,
Like the moon.

U b'aq' nu wach xa katiltotik
Chi yamanik raxa k'uwal,
Nay pu we',
Rax kawakoj chi ab'aj,

Are' k'u ri nu tza'm,

Precious metal therefore my throne.
Still bright surface its face earth
When I go out hither
Before its face my throne.

Puwaq k'ut nu q'alib'al.
K'a saq pak'e u wach ulew
Ta kinel uloq
Chuwach nu q'alib'al.

Thus I sun,
I as well moon,

Keje' k'ut in q'ij wi,
In pu ik',

By light child of woman,
Light son of man.

Rumal saqil al,
Saqil k'ajol.

Then be it so.

Ta chuxoq.

Because far away
It reaches my vision,” says the Seven Macaw.

Rumal chi naj
Kopon wi nu wach,” cha' ri Wuqub' Kaqix. 

Not therefore true this that sun the Seven Macaw,
Only he aggrandises himself,

Ma k'u qitzij are' ta q'ij ri Wuqub' Kaqix,
Xere kunimarisaj rib',

The his plumes,
His precious metal.

Ri u xik',
U puwaq.

Only therefore reaches his face that where he sits.
Not surely everywhere then beneath sky arrives his face

Xere k'ut tokol wi u wach ri chiku'b'e wi.
Ma na ronojel ta u xe' kaj kopon wi u wach

Before therefore truly is seen its face sun,
Moon,

Maja' k'ut qi kiloq u wach q'ij,
Ik',

---
Before it dawns.

Ch'umil,
Maja'oq kasaqiroq.

Thus he puffs himself up
The Seven Macaw

Keje' k'ut kuq'ob'isaj wi rib'
Ri Wuqub' Kaqix

For days,
For months.

Chi q'ijil,
Chi ik'il.

Merely before it would be revealed,
It would be made manifest

Xa maja' chik'utunoq,
Chiq'alajob'oq

Its light sun,
Moon,

U saqil q'ij,
Ik',

Merely he desired greatness,
Transcendence.

Xa xurayij nimal,
Ik'owen.

When then was made flood
Because of effigies carved wood.

Are ta xb'anik b'utik
Kumal poy ajam che'.

Thus we shall tell now when he died Seven Macaw,
When he was defeated,
When were made people
By Framer,
Shaper.
THIS its root
His defeat,
Its shaking now as well his day Seven Macaw

Keje' k'ut xchiqab'ij chik ta xkamik Wuqub' Kaqix,

Merely gods.

Kumal e kaib' k'ajolab',

Because evil they saw him,
The self-aggrandiser.

Rumal itzel xkilo,
Ri nimarisay rib'.

He wanted its doing
Before his face its Heart Sky.

Xraj u b'an
Chuwach u K'u'x Kaj.

Said therefore the boys:

Xcha' k'u ri k'ajolab':

---
Not will live people

“Mawi utz ta chuxoq.
Mawi chik'ase' winaq

Here
On its face earth.

Waral
Chuwach ulew.

Thus we will try blowgun shooting.
Above his food we will blowgun shoot him.

Keje' k'ut chiqatij wub'axik.
Chuwi' recha' chiqawub'aj wi.

There we will put his sickness.
Then finished his wealth,
His jade,
His precious metals,
His jewels,
His glittering things,
That which he keeps vigil over.
Thus it will be done.

Chiri' chiqakoj wi u yab'.

Glory this,
Merely precious metal.

Q'aq'al ri',
Xa puwaq.

Then be it so,”
They said the boys.

Ta chuxoq,”
Xecha' ri k'ajolab'.

Each with blowgun
They shoulder each of them.

Jujun chi wub'
Kitelen ki kab' ichal.

This therefore the Seven Macaw,
They two his sons.

Are' k'u ri Wuqub' Kaqix,
E kaib' u k'ajol.

This first child the Zipacna.
Second child then therefore the Cabracan.

Are' nab'e al ri Sipakna.
U kab' al chi k'ut ri Kab'raqan.

Chimalmat therefore her name their mother,
His wife the Seven Macaw.

Chimalmat k'ut u b'i' ki chuch,
Rixoqil ri Wuqub' Kaqix.

This therefore the Zipacna,
This would sustain
The great mountains-The Chigag,

Are' k'u ri Sipakna,
Are' chirecha'j
Ri nima'q juyub'-Ri Chi' Q'aq',

---
Peculya,

Will be called their names mountains
Existed when it dawns.
Merely one night they are created
By the Zipacna.

This now therefore the Cabracan would shake mountains, Are' ri' chi k'u ri Kab'raqan chisilab' juyub',
By him they would be made to tremble,
Rumal chineb'owik,
Small mountains,
Great mountains by him.

Ch'uti juyub',
Nima juyub' rumal.

Merely as self-aggrandisement
They did his sons Seven Macaw.

Xa wi keje' nimarisab'al kib'
Xkib'ano u k'ajol Wuqub' Kaqix.

“I this,
I sun!”
Said Seven Macaw.
“I this,
I maker earth!”
Said the Zipacna.
“I now therefore,
I fell sky,
I will cause to tumble down all earth,”
Said the Cabracan.

“In wa',
In q'ij!”
Xcha' Wuqub' Kaqix.
“In wa',
In b'anol ulew!”
Xcha' ri Sipakna.
“In chi k'ut,

Xcha' ri Kab'raqan.

Merely his sons Seven Macaw,
Merely there they received their greatness behind their
father.

Xa wi u k'ajol Wuqub' Kaqix,
Xa wi chiri' xkik'am wi ki nimal chirij ki qajaw.

This therefore evil they saw boys,
Before they would be made

Are' k'ut itzel xkil wi k'ajolab',
Maja' chib'antajoq

The manuscript here reads ix (you) rather than in (I), which makes little sense in the context of the passage, as well as the parallel
lines that follow. This is evidently an error in transcription of the text.

The manuscript reads quiyou (block out, impede), which Mondloch (personal communication) suggests is likely a scribal error for
quiyohou (destroy, ruin, fell).

---
Our first father.

Qa nab'e chuch,
Qa nab'e qajaw.

Thus were conceived their deaths,
Their loss by boys.

Keje' k'ut xno'jix wi ki kamik,
Ki sachik kumal k'ajolab'.

THIS therefore his being blowgun shot
Seven Macaw by two boys.

WA'E k'ute u wub'axik
Wuqub' Kaqix kumal kaib' k'ajolab'.

We shall tell their defeat each of them,
The self-aggrandisers.

Xchiqab'ij ki ch'akatajik chi ki jujunal,
Ri nimarisay rib'.

This the Seven Macaw,
A great tree the nance,
This therefore his food
The Seven Macaw.

Are' ri Wuqub' Kaqix,
Jun nima che' ri tapa'l,
Are' k'u recha'
Ri Wuqub' Kaqix.

He would knock down
The its fruit nance.

Are' chulo

He would rise up to its top tree each day.
It was seen therefore his means of feeding

Chaq'an chuwi' che' ju ta q'ij.

By the Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

They keep a vigil now therefore
Beneath tree the Seven Macaw.
They hidden here the two boys
In leaves tree.

Kik'ak'alen chi k'ut

E matzamoj ulo ri kaib' k'ajolab'

Then he arrived therefore Seven Macaw,
Perched

Ta xopon k'ut Wuqub' Kaqix,
Tak'al

Over his food,
The nance.

Chuwi' recha',
Ri tapa'l.

Then therefore he was shot by them,
The Hunahpu, directed straight its pellet blowgun

K'ate k'ut ta xub'axik kumal,
Ri Junajpu, taqal u b'aq' wub'

In this brief section, from lines -, the brother of Xbalanque is referred to in the original manuscript as Hun Hunahpu, the
name used exclusively in the remainder of the text for the father of the twin boys. This is unlikely to be a scribal error because it is

---
He broke open his mouth.

Chu kakate'.
Churaquj u chi'.

Then he came over its top tree
Directed straight onto its face earth.

Ta xpe chuwi' che'
Taqal chuwach ulew.

In a hurry therefore the Hunahpu quickly went,
Truly he went to his grasping.

Chimalmat k'ut ri Junajpu anim xb'ek,
Qitzij wi xb'e u chapa'.

Then therefore was torn off
His arm the Hunahpu by the Seven Macaw.

K'ate k'ut ta xqupix ula
U q'ab' ri Junajpu rumal ri Wuqub' Kaqix.

Straightaway it was thrown back,
It was bent back edge his shoulder.

Ju suk' xtzaq uloq,
Xmejo uloq tza'm u teleb'.

Then he released again therefore Hunahpu
The Seven Macaw.

Ta xutzoqopij chi k'ut Junajpu
Ri Wuqub' Kaqix.

Merely good they did.
Not first their defeat by Seven Macaw

Xa wi utz xkib'ano.
Ma nab'e ki ch'akatajik taj rumal Wuqub' Kaqix

Having taken now therefore his arm the Hunahpu
By the Seven Macaw.

Uk'a'am chi k'ut u q'ab' ri Junajpu
Rumal ri Wuqub' Kaqix.

Then he went to his home,
Ta xb'e chi rochoch,
Merely now therefore holding in palms his jaw he arrived. Xa chi k'u u lot'em u kakate' xoponik.
“What did you get there?”
Said therefore the Chimalmat,
His wife Seven Macaw.
“What is it?”

“Naqi pa mi xk'amow chila'?”
Xcha' k'u ri Chimalmat,
Rixoqil Wuqub' Kaqix.
“Naqi pa ri'?”

“The two demons they shot me with a blowgun,
It was dislocated my jaw by them.

“Ri e kaib' k'axtok' mi xikiwub'aj,
Mi xsilib'ataj nu kakate' rumal.

Merely they torment my teeth,
They ache now.

Xa kachuywaj e we',
Kaq'oxow chik.

repeated consistently. This is more likely evidence of a different K'iche' author, supporting the conclusion that the Popol Vuh is the
product of several scribes.

---
Over fire therefore
It will hang,
It will dangle
Over fire
When they arrive to take it again.

Mi nab'e mi xnuk'am uloq.

True that they demons,” said the Seven Macaw,
When he hung his arm the Hunahpu.

Qitzij chi e k'axtok',” xcha' ri Wuqub' Kaqix,
Ta xuxekeb'a' u q'ab' ri Junajpu.

They plan again,
The One Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.
Then they spoke therefore to

Kina'ojinik chik,
Ri Ju Junajpu,

One Grandfather.
Truly white now

One therefore Grandmother,
Truly humble grandmother now.

Merely they walk bent over now,
Now aged people.

Xa keluq'uq'ila' chik,

White Great Peccary his name grandfather.
White Great Coati therefore her name grandmother.
They said therefore
The boys to them,
The grandmother,
Grandfather:

Saqi Nim Aq u b'i' mama'.
Saqi Nima Sis k'ut u b'i' ati't.
Xecha' k'u
Ri k'ajolab' chike,

“May we accompany you.
You will go then to take our arm with Seven Macaw.

“Kixqachb'ilaj taj.

Merely we follow
Behind you.

Xa kojtere

‘Endure the our grandsons
That accompany us.

‘Q'i' ri qa mam
Ri qachb'ilan.

Dead their mother,

Kaminaq ki chuch,

Ki qajaw.

Thus they follow along,
All around behind us.

Keje' k'ut ketere,
Kotila' wi chiqij.

Then it we give them,
Ta la' keqasipaj wi,
Because merely removal its worms teeth we do,’ you say. Rumal xa elesan u chikopil e'yaj kaqab'ano,’ kixcha'.
Thus therefore the we children
He will see the Seven Macaw.

Keje' k'u ri oj ak'alab'
Chirilo ri Wuqub' Kaqix.

Merely us we give your thoughts,”
They said the they two boys.

Xa wi oj kojya'wik i na'oj,”
Xecha' ri e kaib' k'ajolab'.

“Good then that,” they said therefore.
Afterwards therefore then they went.

“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut.
K'ate k'ut ta xeb'ek.

On edge is seated the Seven Macaw
Before its face his throne.
Then they passed by the grandmother,
Grandfather.
They play therefore
The two boys behind them.
Then they passed by
Below his home
Lord.

Tza'mal ku'bi' ri Wuqub' Kaqix
Chuwach u q'alib'al.
Ta xe'ik'owik ri ati't,
Mama'.
Ke'etz'eyaj k'u

Ta xe'ik'ow

Ajaw.

He broke open therefore his mouth
The Seven Macaw because of his teeth.

Kuraquj k'u u chi'
Ri Wuqub' Kaqix rumal re'.

Then he saw therefore Seven Macaw the grandfather,
Grandmother accompanying each other.

Ta xril k'ut Wuqub' Kaqix ri mama',
Ati't kachb'ilan kib'.

“From where do you come our grandparents?”
Said therefore the lord.

“Apa kixpe wi qa mam?”
Xcha' k'u ri ajaw.

“Merely we self-providers thou lord,” they said therefore. “Xa oj tzuqub'ey qib' lal ajaw,” xecha' k'ut.
“What your means of providing?
“Naqi pa i tzuqub'al?
Not your children that accompany you?”
“Not they are thou lord.

Ma iwalk'wal ri iwachb'ilan?”
“Maja b'i lal ajaw.

Our grandsons

Only surely theirs,
We pity their faces.

Xere na re,
Kaqatoq'ob'aj ki wach.

They receivers a portion,
Piece we give to them thou lord,”

Ri ya'axel ju pir,
Ch'aqa'p kaqaya' chikech lal ajaw,”

They said therefore the grandmother,
Grandfather.

Xecha' k'ut ri ati't,
Mama'.

Finished therefore the lord
Because of its pain his teeth.

Kutzin k'u ri ajaw
Rumal u q'oxom re'.

Merely therefore great this effort now,
He says:

Xa k'u nima'q wa' ch'ij chik,
Kach'awik:

“I then beg to you,
Take pity then on my face.

“In ta b'a kanij chiwech,
Chitoq'ob'aj ta nu wach.

What medicine would you make?
What medicine for your curing?”

Naqi pa ki' chib'ano?
Naqi on ki' chikunaj?”

He said therefore
Lord.
“Merely their worms teeth we would remove.
Merely therefore eyes we would cure.
Merely bones we would set,
Thou lord,”
They said therefore.

Xcha' k'ut
Ajaw.
“Xa u chikopil e'yaj chiqelesaj.
Xa k'u u b'aq' u wach chiqakunaj.
Xa b'aq chiqawiqo,

Xecha' k'ut.

“Good then that,
Cure then my teeth.

“Utz b'a la',
Chikunaj ta b'a we'.

Truly they ache every day.
Not will it be borne.

Qitzij kaq'oxowik ju ta q'ij.
Mawi choq'itajik.

There is not my sleep because of it,
With its seeds my face.

Maja b'i nu waram rumal,
Ruk' u b'aq' nu wach.

Merely they blowgun shot me,
Two demons.

Xa xiki'ub'aj,
E kaib' k'axtok'.

---
Not I eat because of it.

Ta xtikarik
Mawi kinecha'jik rumal.

Thus then take pity on my face.
Merely they molest

Keje' ta k'ut chitoq'ob'aj wi nu wach.
Xa kachuyub'

My jaw now,
The my teeth.”

We je chik,
Ri we'.”

“Good then that thou lord.
Worm then causes them pain.

“Utz b'a la' lal ajaw.
Chikop b'a kaq'axuwik.

Merely will enter their replacement,
They will come out the teeth thine.”

Xa chok u k'exel,
Chel ri e' la.”

“Not then good perhaps they will come out the my teeth,
By them only I lord.

“Ma b'a utz lo chel ri we',
Rumal xere in ajaw wi.

My finery the my teeth,
With its seeds my face.”

Nu kawub'al ri we',
Ruk' u b'aq' nu wach.”

“We shall place now first therefore
Their replacement ground bone.”

“Xchiqakoj chik na k'ut
U k'exel jok'om b'aq.”

It shall enter again this therefore ground bone
The mere white grains of maize.

Xchok chik are' k'ut jok'om b'aq
Ri xa saqi ixim.

“Good then that, take them out, help here,” he said
therefore.
Then came out therefore the his teeth Seven Macaw.

“Utz b'a la', chiwelesaj, chito'o' uloq,”
xcha' k'ut.
Ta xel k'u ri re' Wuqub' Kaqix.

Merely white grains of maize their replacement his teeth
entered,
Merely now therefore white shiny now here grains of
maize in his mouth.

Xa saqi ixim u k'exel re' xokik,

Straightaway therefore fell his face,
Not lord now he appeared.

Ju su k'u xqaj u wach,
Mawi ajaw chik xwachinik.

Completed coming out the his teeth,
Jewels blue/green brilliant in his mouth.

Xk'is elik ri re',
K'uwal rax kawakoj pu chi'.

Then were treated now therefore his eyes Seven Macaw.

Ta xkunax chi k'ut u b'aq' u wach Wuqub' Kaqix.

Xa chi k'u saq julujuj chi ula ixim pu chi'.

---

Ta xch'olik u b'aq' u wach.

Completed its coming out
The precious metal.

Xk'is elik
Ri puwaq.

Not surely pain he felt,
Merely only he stares.

Ma na k'ax taj xuna'o,
Xa wi xere kamuqunik.

Then completed therefore its coming out
The his self-aggrandisement.

Ta xk'is k'u elik
Ri u nimarisab'al rib'.

Merely their plan the Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xa wi ki na'oj ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Then he died therefore the Seven Macaw.
Then he took therefore his arm the Hunahpu.

Ta xkam k'ut ri Wuqub' Kaqix.
Ta xuk'am k'ut u q'ab' ri Junajpu.

She died also Chimalmat,
His wife Seven Macaw.

Xkam nay puch Chimalmat,
Rixoqil Wuqub' Kaqix.

Thus its loss his wealth Seven Macaw.
The mere healers took it away:

Keje' k'ut u sachik u q'inomal Wuqub' Kaqix.
Ri xa aj kun xk'amowik:

The jewels,
Precious stones.

Ri k'uwal,
Yamanik.

They made him proud here
On its face earth.

Xupunab'ej waral
Chuwach ulew.

Enchanted grandmother,
Enchanted grandfather did it.

Nawal ati't,
Nawal mama' xb'anowik.

Then they took therefore
Their arm,

Ta xkik'am k'ut
Ki q'ab',

It was implanted its socket,
Good again it became.

Xtikitax u kok,
Utz chik xuxik.

The parallelism of xkam (he died), and xuk'am (he took), is based not on a similarity of concept but rather a play on the similar
pronunciation of the respective verb roots, a form of intentional punning which the Maya dearly love to do both in every day conversation
as well as in literature.

---
Thus they did it.

Xa rumal u kamik Wuqub' Kaqix xkaj,
Keje' xkib'ano.

Wrong they saw it,
Self-aggrandisement.

Itzel xkilo,
Nimarisab'al ib'.

Then therefore they went again,
They two boys.

K'ate k'ut xeb'e chik,
E kaib' k'ajolab'.

Merely his word the its Heart Sky,
Then they did it.

Xa u tzij ri u K'u'x Kaj,
Ta xkib'ano.

THESE now therefore his deeds now Zipacna,
His first son Seven Macaw.

WA'E chi k'ute u b'anoj chik Sipakna,
U nab'e k'ajol Wuqub' Kaqix.

“I maker mountains,”
Says the Zipacna.

“In b'anol juyub',”
Kacha' ri Sipakna.

He therefore the Zipacna
Bathes at its mouth river

Are' k'u ri Sipakna
Katinik chuchi' ja'

When they passed by
Five eighties boys.
They dragging tree,
Its supporting beam their hut.
Five eighties
Were walking along.

Ta xe'ik'owik
O' much' k'ajolab'.
E jur wi che',
Raqan ki kab'al.
O' much'
Chub'inik.

When they cut down therefore a great tree,
Its lintel their hut.

Ta xkiq'at k'ut jun nima che',
U wapalil ki kab'al.

Then therefore went the Zipacna,
K'ate k'ut xb'e ri Sipakna,
He arrived therefore there with them the five eighties boys. Xopon k'u chila' kuk' ri o' much' k'ajolab'.
“What you do,
You boys?”

“Naqi pa kib'ano,
Ix k'ajolab'?”

“Merely tree,
Not we lift it

“Xa che',
Mawi kaqayako

To shoulder it.”
“I will carry it on my shoulders.

Chiteleb'a'.”
“Xchintelej.

---
What its use in your hearts?”

Apa kopon wi?
Naqi pa u chak chi i k'u'x?”

“Merely its lintel
Our hut.”

“Xa u wapalil
Qa kab'al.”

“Good then that,”
He says therefore.

“Utz b'a la',”
Cha' k'ut.

Then he dragged it therefore,
He carried it on his shoulders therefore up

Ta xujuruj k'ut,
Xuteleb'a' k'u aq'anoq

To its mouth their hut
Five eighties boys.

Chuchi' ki kab'al
O' much' k'ajolab'.

“Merely then be with us,
You boy.

“Xa ta wi katk'oje' quk',
At k'ajol.

Is there your mother,
Your father?”

K'o pa a chuch,
A qajaw?”

“There are not,”
He said therefore.

“Maja b'i,”
Xcha' k'ut.

“We ask for your help then surely then that.
Tomorrow will be raised another

“Kaqacha'kimaj ta na b'a la'.
Chuwe'q chuwab'axik chik

An our tree,
Its supporting beam our hut.”

Jun qa che',
Raqan qa kab'al.”

“Good,”
He said again therefore.

“Utz,”
Xcha' chi k'ut.

Then therefore were gathered their thoughts,
The five eighties boys.

K'ate k'ut xk'am ki na'oj,
Ri o' much' k'ajolab'.

“This the boy, what will we do to him?
We will kill him,

“Are' ri ala, jupacha chiqab'an chire?
Chiqakamisaj taj,

Because not good what he does.
Merely alone he lifted the tree.

Rumal mawi utz ri kub'ano.
Xa u tukel mi xuyak ri che'.

---
Then therefore we shall abandon him down in hole.

Qa k'oto' jun nima jul chiri',
Ta k'ut chiqatzaq wi qajoq pa jul.

‘Go get it,
Bottom earth in hole,’ we say then to him again.

‘Jak'ama',
Qaja ulew pa jul,’ kojcha' ta chire chi.

While then therefore bent over down in hole,
Then we hurl down the great tree there.

Are ta k'ut pachal qajoq pa jul,
Ta qatarij qajoq ri nima che' chiri'.

Then therefore he will die in hole,”
They said therefore five eighties boys.

Ta k'ut chikam wi pa jul,”
Xecha' k'ut o' much' k'ajolab'.

Then they dug therefore a great hole deep it went down.
Then they summoned therefore the Zipacna:

Ta xkik'ot k'ut jun nima jul najt xqajik.
Ta xkitaq k'ut ri Sipakna:

“We entrust to you,
Go then to dig now earth.

“Oj kanij chawech,
Chib'e ta a k'oto chik ulew.

Not do we find it,” he was told.
“Good then that,” he said therefore.

Mawi kaqariqo,” xuchaxik.
“Utz b'a la',” xcha' k'ut.

Then therefore he went down in hole.
“Call hither

K'ate k'ut xqaj pa jul.
“Kasik'in uloq

When it shall have been dug up the earth,
Deep then it will go down because of you,”

Ta k'ototajoq ri ulew,
Naj ta chiqajik awumal,”

He was told.
“Fine,” he said therefore.

Xuchaxik.
“We',” xcha' k'ut.

Then he began its digging hole.
Ta xutikib'a' u k'otik jul.
Merely therefore its hole he dug his means of self-salvation.Xa k'u u jul xuk'oto u kolb'al rib'.
He learned of the his being killed.
Then he dug therefore another head in hole to its side.

Xreta'maj ri u kamisaxik.
Ta xuk'ot k'ut jun wi' chi jul chu tzalanem.

Second hole he dug,
He was saved.

U ka jul xuk'oto,
Xkolotaj wi.

“To how far down in it?”
Was said therefore down by five eighties boys.

“K'a janik'an pa la'?”
Xuchax k'u qajoq kumal o' much' k'ajolab'.

“I hasten its digging.

“Kinan u k'oto.

---

We xkixnusik'ij aq'anoq,

Then it will be successful its being dug,”
Said hither Zipacna there in hole.

Ta chutzinoq u k'ototajik,”
Xcha' uloq Sipakna chiri' pa jul.

Not therefore he digs its bottom hole
The his burial.
Merely its hole he digs
Means of self-salvation.

Ma k'u are' kuk'ot u xe' jul
Ri u muqikil.
Xa u jul kuk'oto
Kolb'al rib'.

Then therefore when he called hither the Zipacna,
Saved from inside there in hole when he called hither.

K'ate k'ut ta xsik'in uloq ri Sipakna,
Kolon chuka chiri' pa jul ta xsik'in uloq.

“Come you.
Arrive

“Kixpetoq.
Chul

To take earth,
Its remnants hole.

I k'ama' ulew,
Rachaq jul.

It was dug.
Truly deep it went down by me.

Mi xk'ototajik.
Qitzij naj mi xqaj wumal.

Cannot you hear my call perhaps?
This therefore the your call.

Ma pa kita nu sik'ib'al lo?
Are' k'u ri i sik'ib'al.

Merely thither
It echoes,

Xa ub'i
Kaxojanik,

Like one remove,
Two removes you are.

Keje' ri' jun eleb'al,
Kaib' eleb'al ix k'o wi.

I hear it,”
He said hither the Zipacna in his hole.

Kanuta'o,”
Xcha' ula ri Sipakna pa u jul.

There therefore sheltered now hither,
He calls out now hither in hole.

Chiri' k'ut matzal chi wi uloq,
Kasik'iyaj chi ula pa jul.

This therefore is dragged hither the their great tree
by boys,
Then also they hurled down the tree in hole.

Are' k'ut kajurux uloq ri ki nima che' rumal k'ajolab',

K'ate puch xkitarij qajoq ri che' pa jul.

The text says vmoquiquil, which is likely a scribal error considering the context.

---
Not he speaks,

“Ma k'o,
Ma ch'awik,

We will hear when he breaks open his mouth,
Then he shall be dead,”

Chiqata na ta churaquj u chi',
Ta kamoq,”

They said to each other.
Merely they whisper.

Xecha' chi kib'il kib'.
Xa kejaslajik.

Merely also they would hide their faces
Each one of them.

Xa pu chimatzalaj ki wach
Chi ki jujunal.

Then they hurled down the tree.
When therefore he spoke therefore.
Then he broke open his mouth.
Merely one word more he called,
Then was dropped out the tree.

Ta xkitarij qajoq ri che'.
Are k'u xcha' k'ut.
Ta xuraquj u chi'.
Xa ju paj chik xsik'inik,
Ta xqaj apanoq ri che'.

“Aha, it was successful!
Truly good!

“Oka, mi xutzinik!
Qi utz!

We did it to him.
He died.

Mi xqab'ano chire.
Mi xkamik.

What then omen
Would persist

Ata lab'e
Chitaqen

Would he do it,
Would he work?

Chub'ano,
Chuchakuj?

Then he shall become
First thing.

Ta chuxoq
U nab'e la'.

He placed here himself with us,
Among us as well,

Xukoj ula rib' quk',
Chiqaxo'l puch,

Even us,
Five eighties boys!”

La' oj,
O' much' chi k'ajolab'!”

They said therefore.
They rejoice now.

Xecha' k'ut.
Keki'kot chik.

Chi frequently follows numbers in K'iche' speech and has no separable meaning.

---
They pass three days also,

“K'o ri' u b'anik qa ki' oxij.
Ke'ek'owik oxij puch,

We will drink to dwelling,
Our hut,

Chiquk'aj laq'ab'eb'al,
Qa kab'al,

Even us,
Five eighties boys!” they said.

La' oj,
O' much' chi k'ajolab'!” xecha'.

“Tomorrow therefore we will see it.
Two days also we will see it,

“Chuwe'q k'ut chiqilo.
Kab'ij puch chiqilo,

If not they come ants
From earth.

Ma pa chipe sanik
Pu ulew.

When he shall smell,
When decomposed.

Ta chuwinoq,
Ta q'eyoq.

Then therefore comforted again our hearts,
When we drink the our sweet drink,” they said therefore.

K'ate k'ut ku'ul chi qa k'u'x,
Ta quk'aj ri qa ki',” xecha' k'ut.

He hears therefore hither
The Zipacna there in hole

Kuta' k'u uloq
Ri Sipakna chiri' pa jul

When they said the boys this.
Until on the second day as well,

Ta xkib'ij k'ajolab' ri'.
K'a chukab'ij puch,

Then assembled ants.
They walk about,
They swarm.
Then they gathered beneath tree.

Ta xtub'ukij sanik.
Keb'inowik,
Keb'uchuwik.
Ta xek'ulun xe' che'.

Everywhere they carry with their teeth hair,
They carry with their teeth as well his nails Zipacna.

Jumaj ki kayelo'n is,
Ki kayelo'n puch rixk'aq Sipakna.

Then they saw therefore
The boys:

Ta xkil k'u
Ri k'ajolab':

“He was finished the demon.
Look at surely ants!

“Mi pa xutzin ri k'axtok'.
Chiwila' na sanik!

They gathered hither,

Mi xek'ulun uloq,

---

Mi xetub'ukij uloq.

Everywhere hair they carry with their teeth.
There are his nails that can be seen surely.

Jumaj is ki kayen.
K'o rixk'aq ri chila' na.

We did it at last,”
They said to each other.

Mi xqab'ano k'a,”
Xecha' chi kib'il kib'.

He therefore the Zipacna merely alive.
He cut off its hair his head.

Are' k'u ri Sipakna xa wi k'aslik.
Xuq'at uloq rismal u wi'.

Merely as well he gnaws off his nails,
He gives them away to them the ants.

Xa pu kuk'ux uloq rixk'aq,
Chire kuya' ula chikech ri sanik.

Thus he died
They thought five eighties boys.

Keje' k'u ri' xkamik
Xkina'o o' much' k'ajolab'.

Then therefore they began their sweet drink on third day.
Then they got drunk also all boys,
They therefore were drunk now all five eighties boys,
There is not they feel now.

K'ate k'ut xtikar ki ki' chi roxij.
Ta xeq'ab'ar puch konojel k'ajolab',
E k'u q'ab'arinaq chik konojel o' much' k'ajolab',
Maja b'i kakina' chik.

Then also it was collapsed the hut
On their heads by the Zipacna.

K'ate puch xulix ri kab'al
Pa ki wi' rumal ri Sipakna.

They were finished,
They were stricken all of them.

Xek'is,
Ch'ayatajik konojel.

There is not even one,
Two were saved of them the five eighties boys.

Maja b'i chik jun,
Kaib' xkolotaj chikech ri o' much' chi k'ajolab'.

They were killed by Zipacna,
His son the Seven Macaw.

Xekamisaxik rumal Sipakna,
U k'ajol ri Wuqub' Kaqix.

Thus their death,
Five eighties boys these.

Keje' k'ut ki kamik,
O' much' k'ajolab' ri'.

It was said then therefore that they entered to constellation, Xcha' chi k'ut are' ri xe'ok chi ch'umilal,
The Motz its name by them.
Ri Motz u b'i' kumal.
If therefore merely whiteness word perhaps.
This now therefore we will tell

We k'ut xa saqb'al tzij lo.

---
By the two boys,

U ch'akatajik chik Sipakna
Rumal ri e kaib' k'ajolab',

Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

THIS now his defeat,
His death Zipacna,

ARE' chik u ch'akatajik,
U kamik Sipakna,

When he was defeated now
By the two boys,

Ta xch'ak chik
Kumal ri e kaib' k'ajolab',

Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

This now offends their hearts boys,
The five eighties boys they died because of Zipacna.

Are' chi kuyoq' ki k'u'x k'ajolab',
Ri o' much' chi k'ajolab' xekamik rumal Sipakna.

Merely fish,
Merely crabs,

Xa kar,
Xa tap,

He would search for them in rivers.
Only this he would feed upon each day,

Chutzukuj chi taq a'.
Xere chirecha'j ju ta q'ij,

By day he would wander when he would search for his food,Pa q'ij chiwa'katik ta chutzukuj recha',
By night therefore he would carry on his back mountains. Chaq'ab' k'ut chireqaj juyub'.
Then therefore its transformation
A great crab

K'ate k'ut u jalwachixik
Jun nima tap

By Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Kumal Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

This therefore they used the its face bromelia flower,
The picked bromelia flower that is in forests.

Are' k'ut xkikoj ri u wach ek',
Ri mak ek' k'o pa taq k'eche'laj.

This its claws crab became on opening.
Also therefore its shell arms they used.

Are' u xul tap xuxik pa jaq.
Chi k'ut u kok q'ab' xkikojo.

Hollowed out stone therefore the its backside crab,
That is placed on the ground.

Sel ab'aj k'u ri u wa rachaq tap,
Ri jowojik.

---
At its bottom great mountain.

K'ate k'ut ta xkikoj u kok chuxe' pek,
Chuxe' nima juyub'.

Meauan its name mountain,
He was defeated.

Meawan u b'i' juyub',
Xch'akataj wi.

Then therefore when they came the boys,
They found the Zipacna at river.

K'ate k'ut ta xepe ri k'ajolab',
Xkik'u ri Sipakna chi ya'.

“Where are you going,
You boy?”
Was asked therefore the Zipacna.
“There is not I go.
Merely my food I search for,
You boys,”
Said therefore the Zipacna.
“What your food?”

“Apa katb'e wi,
At k'ajol?”
Xcha'x k'u ri Sipakna.
“Maja b'i kinb'e wi.
Xa wecha' kanutzukuj,

Xcha' k'u ri Sipakna.
“Naqi pa awecha'?”

“Only fish,
Only crabs.

“Xa kar,
Xa tap.

Xma k'o chi wi

Two days ago I had to leave off being fed.
Not do I bear now hunger,”

Kab'ijir chinkanaj recha'xik.

Said Zipacna to Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xcha' Sipakna chikech Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

“One this crab is there below canyon.
True that great crab.

“Jun are' la' tap k'o ula xe' siwan.

Try your luck then,
You will eat it perhaps.

Kaq'ij ta la',

Merely it bites us.
It wanted to grab us.

Xa kojuti'o.
Mi xraj qa chapo.

We are afraid because of it.
Not he will go, you grab it,”

Kaqaxib'ij qib' rumal.
Ma chib'e on, kachapa',”

Said the Hunahpu,

“Take pity on my face.
Go then to guide me,

“Kitoq'ob'a' nu wach.
Kib'e ta i wab'a',

You boys,”
Said the Zipacna.

Ix k'ajolab',”
Xcha' ri Sipakna.

“Not then we would want to.
Merely then you go.
Not way of getting lost,
Merely its leg river you go,
You therefore standing out there below great mountain,
Placed hither below canyon.
Merely you go out there,”

“Ma b'a chiqaj.
Xa ta katb'ek.
Ma sachib'al taj,
Xa raqan ja' katb'ek,
At k'u tak'al aponoq xe' nima juyub',

They said Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xecha' Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

“Please,
Pity my face.

“La qi b'a,
Toq'ob' nu wach.

Not then it was found you boys.
You go first therefore to guide me.

Ma b'a xuk'ulu ix k'ajolab'.
Kixb'e na k'u nu wab'a'.

There are many surely the birds.
You could go to blowgun shoot them.

K'o k'i xo wi ri tz'ikin.
Chib'e taj iwub'aj.

I know where they are,”
Said then therefore Zipacna.

Weta'm k'o wi,”
Xcha' chi k'ut Sipakna.

He humbled himself with promise of reward,
He wept surely before their faces boys.

Xelajik,
Xoq' na chikiwach k'ajolab'.

“Alas not truly therefore you shall grab perhaps,
Then merely like we shall return by you.

“La ma qi k'u xchachap lo,
Ta xa keje' xkojtzalij awumal.

Not only not we ate it,
Merely straighataway would bite this.

Ma xa mawi xqatijo,
Xa ju suk' chiti'onik ri'.

We on stomachs
We enter thither.
Then therefore frightened this.

Oj jupulik

K'ate k'ut kuxib'ij rib' ri'

---
We enter thither.
Merely therefore a little later,
Not would we find it.
Then therefore good you on back
You enter thither,”

Oj pak'alik
Kojok ub'ik.
Xa k'u sqaqi'n chik,
Mawi chiqariqo.
K'ate k'u utz at pak'alik
Katok ub'ik,”

He was told therefore.
“Good then that,” said therefore the Zipacna.

Xuchax k'ut.
“Utz b'a la',” xcha' k'u ri Sipakna.

Then they went therefore,
Accompanied by now therefore the Zipacna.

Ta xb'e k'ut,
Achb'ilan chi k'ut ri Sipakna.

They went,
They arrived at its bottom canyon.

Xb'ek,
Xe'opon chuxe' siwan.

Placed therefore it the crab.
Red bright there its back below canyon.

Tzalam k'u la' ri tap.
Kaq wakawoj ula rij xe' siwan.

This therefore their deception.
Ri' k'ute ki kumatzij.
“Good then that,” he would rejoice therefore the Zipacna. “Utz b'a la',” chiki'kot k'u ri Sipakna.
He wants greatly,
It shall enter then in his mouth,
Because truly finished with hunger.
He wanted to eat this.

Karaj taj,
Xkok ta pu chi',
Rumal qitzij kutzin chi waij.
Xraj kutij ri'.

Merely he wanted on stomach
He wanted to enter.

Xa xraj jupunik
Xraj okik.

High therefore the crab climbed up.
Then therefore he went out from there.

Paqal k'u ri tap xaq'anik.
K'ate k'ut xel chu uloq.

“Not you found it?” he was told therefore.
“There is not.

“Mawi xariqo?” xuchax k'ut.
“Maja b'i.

Merely high
It climbed up.
Merely first a little more
Not I found it.
Then good perhaps I on my back
I enter thither,” he said now therefore.
Then therefore on his back now

Xa paqalik

Completed therefore entrance thither.
Merely its head his knee now was showing hither.
Completed being swallowed up.

Xk'is k'u ok ub'ik.
Xa u wi' u ch'ek chik xk'utun uloq.
Xk'is b'iq'itajik.

Settled therefore down great mountain upon his chest.
Not he turned over again.

Xlilob' k'u qajoq nima juyub' chi u k'u'x.
Mawi xsolkopij chik.

Stone therefore came to be the Zipacna.
Thus his defeat now Zipacna

Cabracan his name.
“I wrecker mountains,” he said.

Kab'raqan u b'i'.
“In yojol juyub',” xcha'.

Merely therefore only Hunahpu,
Xbalanque,

Xa wi k'u xere Junajpu,

Was his being defeated Cabracan.
Said the Huracan,

Xch'akow re Kab'raqan.
Xcha' ri Juraqan,

Sudden Thunderbolt when they spoke

Ch'i'pi Kaqulja,

To then the Hunahpu,
Xbalanque:

Chikech ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke:

“Second his son Seven Macaw one other,
One other will be defeated.

“U kab' u k'ajol Wuqub' Kaqix jun chik,

They surpass sun

Ki b'anoj chuwach ulew.

Not therefore as it should be.
Lure him therefore away

Ma k'u keje' chuxik.

Chila'

Said therefore the Huracan
To the two boys.

Xcha' k'ut ri Juraqan

“Good then that,
Thou lord.

“Utz b'a la',

We have always been thus,
Not good we see him.

Qe wi na k'ut,
Mawi utz wi kaqilo.

Not where thou art,

Ma pa lal k'olik,

They said therefore the boys,

Lal u K'u'x Kaj,”
Xecha' k'ut ri k'ajolab',

When they responded to
His word Huracan.

Ta xkik'ulub'a'
U tzij Juraqan.

He also is occupied the Cabracan,

Are' puch katajin ri Kab'raqan,

---

Yojol juyub'.

Merely a little he would tap his foot on its face earth,
Straightaway would tumble down

Xa sqaqi'n chutinij raqan chuwach ulew,
Ju su chiwulij

Great mountains,
Small mountains by him.

Nima juyub',
Ch'uti juyub' rumal.

Then he was met
By the boys.

Ta xk'ulutaj
Kumal ri k'ajolab'.

“Where you go you boy?”
They said to him,
The Cabracan.
“There is not I go.

“Apa katb'e wi at k'ajol?”
Xecha' chirech,
Ri Kab'raqan.
“Maja b'i kinb'e wi.

Merely I feller mountain,
I also wrecker of it,

Xa in uliy juyub',
In puch yojol rech,

As long as goes sun,
As long as goes light,”

Chi b'e q'ij,
Chi b'e saq,”

He said therefore
When he spoke.

Xcha' k'ut
Ta xch'awik.

He said again therefore
The Cabracan

Xcha' chi k'ut
Ri Kab'raqan

To them the Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Chike ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

“Where did you come from?
Not I know your faces.

“Jupacha xpetik?
Mawi weta'm i wach.

What are your names?” said Cabracan.
“There are not our names.

Naqi pa i b'i'?” xcha' Kab'raqan.
“Maja b'i qa b'i'.

Merely we have blowgun hunted,
Merely also we have trapped in mountains.

Xa oj ub'om,
Xa pu oj tzarab'om pa taq juyub'.

The manuscript reads bulih, which is likely a scribal error for vulih.

---
There is not what is ours you boy.

Xa oj meb'a'.
Maja b'i naqi la' qech at k'ajol.

Merely small mountains,
Merely great mountains we go you boy.

Xa ch'uti juyub',
Xa nima juyub' kojb'ek at k'ajol.

This therefore the one great mountain we saw.
Merely incessantly

Are' k'u ri jun nima juyub' xqilo.

It grows,
Truly far it rises up.
Merely it increases in size,
It surpasses to its top mountains all.

Kak'iyik,
Qitzij najt kaq'anik.
Xa kaq'upupik,
Kik'owik chuwi' juyub' ronojel.

There is not therefore one,
Two birds

Ma k'u ja b'i jun,

We caught before its face you boy.
Is it therefore true you fell all mountains you boy?”

Mi xqak'am chuwach at k'ajol.
We k'ut qitzij kawulij ronojel juyub' at k'ajol?”

They asked the Hunahpu,
Xbalanque to Cabracan.

Xecha' ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke chire Kab'raqan.

“Not true you saw it
The mountain you say?

“Ma qitzij xiwilo

Where is it?
You shall see it surely,
I shall fell it down.
Where did you see it?”

Apa k'o wi?
Xchiwil na,
Xchinwulij qajoq.
Apa xiwil wi?”

“There then it is
At its coming out sun,”

“Chila' b'a k'o wi

They said therefore Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xecha' k'ut Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

“Good.
Take our road,”

“Utz.
Chik'ama' qa b'e,”

They were told therefore,
The two boys.

Xe'uchax k'u,

Between us you are,

“Maja b'i, xa kachape nik'aj

One to your left,
One to your right hand of us.

Jun chamox,

Because there are our blowguns,
If there are birds we will shoot them,”

Rumal k'o qa wub',
We k'o tz'ikin chiqawub'aj,”

They said therefore.
They rejoice

Xecha' k'ut.
Keki'kot

That they will practice
Their blowgun shooting.

Chikitijtob'ela'
Ki wub'anik.

This therefore when they shoot blowguns,
Not surely clay its pellet their blowguns.

Are' k'u ri ta kewub'anik,
Ma na ulew taj u b'aq' ki wub'.

Merely they would blow at the birds when they would
shoot blowguns.
He would be amazed therefore the Cabracan.

Xa chikuxlab'ij ri tz'ikin ta chikiwub'aj.

Then they twist-drilled therefore
Their fire the boys.

Ta xkib'aq k'u
Ki q'aq' ri k'ajolab'.

They roasted therefore their birds on its face fire.
One therefore bird they coated quicklime
On its skin.
White earth they put on it.
“This therefore we will give to him
When become ravenous with hunger,
When he savors also its aroma our birds.
Then he is defeated.
This therefore the earth shall enter
On its skin
Bird by us in earth
We will cook it.

One shaping,

Then may it be sown,
Then may it dawn,” they said the boys.

Ta chawaxoq,

“Because merely he shall desire
His wanting with all his heart

“Rumal xa xchirayin wi

This which he will eat,
Which will be cooked,

Ri' chiti'k,
Chichaq'uxik,

Thus shall desire

Keje' xchurayij
U k'u'x ri Kab'raqan,”

They said to each other Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xecha' chi kib'il kib' Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Then they roasted the birds,
It was cooked therefore golden-brown its roasting.

Ta xkib'ol ri tz'ikin,
Xchaq'aj k'ut q'an u b'olik.

It would drip now grease its skin the birds,
It would smell fragrant its aroma.

Chiyipowik chi kab'chiyanik kij ri tz'ikin,
Chik'owinik simisoj ruxlab'.

He therefore the Cabracan
Desires then to be fed.

Are' k'u ri Kab'raqan
Kurayij chik recha'xik.

Merely it overflows
Its secretions in his mouth.

Xa kawajin

Merely he gulps,
He drools also

Xa kab'iq'ilajik,
Kaqurulaj puch

His saliva,
His spittle,

U chub',
U k'axaj,

Because of their fragrance birds.
Then he begged therefore:

Rumal u simsojil tz'ikin.
Ta xutz'onoj k'ut:

“What the your food?
Truly delicious its aroma I smell.

“Naqi pa ri iwecha'?
Qitzij kus ruxlab' kanuna'o.

---
Then they gave therefore a bird to him Cabracan.

Chiya' ta sqaqi'n wech,” xcha' k'ut.
Ta xya' k'ut jun tz'ikin chire Kab'raqan.

His defeat therefore this.
Then therefore he finished the bird.

U ch'akatajik k'u ri'.
K'ate k'ut xuk'is ri tz'ikin.

Then they went again therefore,
They arrived therefore

Ta xb'e chi k'ut,
Xe'opon k'u

There its coming out sun,
Where is the great mountain.

Chila' releb'al q'ij,
K'o wi ri nima juyub'.

He therefore,
The Cabracan,

Are' k'u,
Ri Kab'raqan,

Merely weakened now his legs,
His arms.

Xa tub'ul chik raqan,

Not he will be strong again
Because of the earth coated

Ma b'i chikowin chik
Rumal ri ulew xk'u'l

On its skin bird
He ate.

Chirij tz'ikin

Not therefore is there now
What he did again to mountains.

Ma k'u ja b'i' chik
Naqi la' xub'an chik chire juyub'.

Not was it successful
Their causing to be fallen apart.

Mawi xutzinik

Then he was tied up therefore by boys.
Behind him tied up his hands.
Care was taken of his hands by boys.
Tied up therefore its neck his legs its two together.

Ta xim k'ut kumal k'ajolab'.
Chirij xim wi u q'ab'.
Xrilij u q'ab' kumal k'ajolab'.
Xim k'ut u qul raqan u kab' ichal.

Then therefore they hurled him down into earth,
They buried him.

K'ate k'ut xkitarij qajoq pulew,

Thus his being defeated Cabracan,
These merely only

Merely half we shall tell,
Merely little part its telling their father.

The manuscript reads camuh, although from the context the root verb should likely be camuluh (to retell, repeat, review, go over).

---
These their names the One Hunahpu, they are called.

WA'E k'ute u tzijoxik

They arrive to play ball.
May we defeat them therefore.

There is not their honor,

Certainly they act arrogantly here over our heads,”
They said therefore all Xibalba.

This therefore their task,
The blood they would sicken person.

This therefore their dominion,
These would swell up person.

Are' k'ut kajawarem,

Would come pus on its skin his legs,
Would come jaundice on its skin his face,

Chipe puj chirij raqan,

To jaundice as it is said.
Then therefore their dominion

Then he would go face down on its face earth,
Then he would die.

Ta chib'e jupuloq chuwach ulew,

This therefore their dominion Demon Sweepings,
Demon Stabbings they are called.

Are' k'ut kajawarem Ajal Mes,

These then therefore the Lord Wing,
Packstrap their names.

Merely sudden death as it is called.

There would come blood in his mouth,
Then he would die vomiting blood.

Merely each to their task,
Their shouldered burden.

Merely they would wear out his neck,
His heart person.

Xa chikikosij u qulel,
U k'u'x winaq.

Then he would die on road.
Merely they would cause it to happen outside

Ta chikam pa b'e.

If he would go walking,
They would arrive.

This therefore their dominion Wing,
Packstrap this.

Are' k'ut kajawarem Xik',

These therefore they gathered together
Their thoughts these

Are' k'ut xkikuch

When they were persecuted,
When they were harassed as well

Their journey to Xibalba.

Are' chi k'ut xchiqab'ij chik

They remained therefore behind the One Batz,
[One] Chouen,

Xekanaj k'u kanoq ri Jun B'atz',
[Jun] Chowen,

His sons
One Hunahpu.

U k'ajol

One Batz,

By Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Kumal Junajpu,

THEN therefore their coming messengers by One Death,
Seven Death.

K'ATE k'ut ki petik samajel rumal Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

“Go you their councilors warriors.
Go to summon

“Kixb'ek ix raj pop achij.

Truly we marvel greatly now,
Thus then they come, they say lords.

Qitzij kaqamayijaj k'i chi,
Keje' ta k'ut kepe wi, kecha' ajawab'.

May they bring therefore hither

Chikik'am k'u uloq

The manuscript reads byc. Mondloch (personal communication) suggests that this should likely be beyc, which is the current
pronunciation of the word. This is either an archaic form or a scribal error.

The manuscript leaves out the jun (one), although it is implied (see line ).

---

Ri ki chokonisan:

Their yokes,
Their arm protectors,
Will come also the their rubber ball,

Ki b'ate,
Ki pach' q'ab',
Chipe nay puch ri ki kik',

They say lords,’
Tell them when you shall arrive,”

Kecha' ajawab',’
Kixcha' ta kixoponoq,”

They were told the messengers.
These therefore their messengers the owls:

Xe'uchaxik ri samajel.
Are' k'ut ki samajel ri tukur:

Arrow Owl
One Leg Owl,
Macaw Owl,
Skull Owl,

Ch'ab'i Tukur,
Juraqan Tukur,

They are called,
Its messengers Xibalba.

This the Arrow Owl,

Merely piercing.
This therefore the One Leg Owl
Merely one his leg,
There are his wings.
This therefore the Macaw Owl
Red his back,
There are his wings.
This now also the Skull Owl,
Merely alone his skull.
There are no his legs,
Merely his wings there are.

They four the messengers,
Their councilors warriors their burden.

E kajib' ri samajel,
Raj pop achijab' keqalem.

Then they came therefore there,
From Xibalba.

Ta xepe k'ut chila',

Suddenly then they arrived,
They therefore perched

They play ball therefore,

In ballcourt,
The Honor,

They therefore alighted the owls
On its top ballcourt.

E k'u tak'atoj ri tukur
Chuwi' jom.

Then they framed therefore their words,
Merely only its order their words

Ta xkitz'aq k'ut ki tzij,

Were framed their words by owls.

Ki b'i' konojel ajawab',
Xtz'aq ki tzij kumal tukur.

“Not their words they say lords
One Death,
Seven Death?
Their words then that they say.

“Ma ki tzij kacha' ajaw
Jun Kame,

Ki tzij b'a la' kecha'.

---
‘You will bring hither the all gaming things,’

Oj na k'u achb'ilay iwe.
‘Chik'am uloq ri ronojel ketz'ab'al,’

They say lords.”
“Good then that.

Kecha' ajawab'.”
“Utz b'a la'.

You wait for us first,
We first leave instructions behind surely our mother,”
they said therefore.

Kojiwoyob'ej na,
Oj na qa pixab'aj kan na qa chuch,”
xecha' k'ut.

They went therefore to their home,
They spoke therefore to their mother.

Xeb'e k'ut chi kochoch,
Xecha' k'ut chire ki chuch.

He had died their father.
“We go surely you our mother.

Xkaminaqoq ki qajaw.
“Jo' na ix qa chuch.

Recently they arrive,
They arrived his messengers lord,

Xa et kulik,
Mi xul u samajel ajaw,

Takers of us.
‘They must come,’ is said therefore.
They say
Summoners of us.

K'amol qe.
‘Kepetoq,’ kacha' k'ut.
Kecha'
Taqol qe.

It shall remain therefore behind this our rubber ball,”
they said therefore.
Then they went to tie it up behind above house.

Xchikanaj k'u kan wa' qa kik',” xecha' k'ut.

“We arrive surely,
Then we shall use it again.”

“Kojul na,
K'ate chiqachokonisaj chik.”

“Merely play the flute,
Merely also sing,

“Xa kixsu'anoq,
Xa pu kixb'ixanoq,

Write,
Carve.

Kixtz'ib'anoq,
Kixk'otonoq.

You shall warm our home,
You shall warm also her heart your grandmother,”

Chimeq'oj qochoch,
Chimeq'oj puch u k'u'x iwati't,”

They were told therefore One Batz,

Xe'uchax k'ut Jun B'atz',

K'ate xb'e ki xima kanoq puwi' ja.

The manuscript reads tzuanoc. Apparently a scribal error for zuanoc.

---

Jun Chowen ta xepixab'axik.

Bitterly therefore
She shall weep

Q'usq'us k'ut

Their mother,
The Xmucane.

Ki chuch,
Ri Xmuqane.

“We go surely,
There is not we die.
Do not grieve,”
They said when they went,

“Jo' na,

Xecha' ta xeb'ek,

One Hunahpu,
Seven Hunahpu.

Jun Junajpu,
Wuqub' Junajpu.

THEN also when they went One Hunahpu,
Seven Hunahpu.

K'ATE puch ta xeb'ek Jun Junajpu,
Wuqub' Junajpu.

It was taken their road by the messengers,
Then they descended therefore on its path Xibalba.

Xk'am ki b'e kumal ri samajel,
Ta xeqaj k'ut pu b'e'al Xib'alb'a.

Steep its mouth steps,
They descended therefore.

Xuluxuj u chi' kumuk,
Xeqaj k'ut.

Then they went out again therefore beyond
At its mouth turbulent river canyons,

Ta xe'el chi k'u aponoq
Chuchi' jal ja' siwanub',

Trembling Canyon,
Murmuring Canyon their names.

Nu' Siwan,
K'ulk'u Siwan u b'i'.

They passed through.
They passed through again therefore

Xe'ik'ow wi.
Xe'ik'ow chi k'ut

Into turbulent rivers:
River Scorpion,
Not counted scorpions.
They passed through,
Not they were stung.

Chupan jal ja'l:
Ja' Simaj,
Mawi ajilan simaj.
Xe'ik'ow wi,
Mawi xetoq'otajik.

The manuscript reads xeeco. This is either an archaic form of the modern K'iche' xe'ik'ow (they passed through), or a scribal error.

---
At Blood River.
They passed through there,
Not they drank.
They arrived at river,
Alone pus at river.
Not they were defeated,
Merely they passed through again.

Ta xe'opon chi k'ut chi a',
Chi Kik'i A'.
Xe'ik'ow chiri',
Mawi xkuk'aj.
Xe'opon chi a',
U tukel puj chi a'.
Mawi xech'akatajik,
Xa wi xe'ik'ow chik.

Then they arrived again therefore on four crossing roads,
Yet there therefore they were defeated on four crossing
roads:

Ta xe'opon chi k'ut pa kajib' xalkat b'e,
K'a chiri' k'ut xech'akataj wi pa kajib' xalkat b'e:

One red road,
One therefore black road,
White road one,
One therefore yellow road.

Jun kaqa b'e,
Jun k'ut q'eqa b'e,
Saqi b'e jun,
Jun k'ut q'ana b'e.

Four roads.

Kajib' b'e.

This therefore said the black road:
“I, you take me.
I his road lord,”
Said the road.

Are' k'ut xch'aw ri q'eqa b'e:
“In kinik'amo.
In u b'e ajaw,”
Xch'aw ri b'e.

There therefore
They were defeated.
This they began the road Xibalba.
Then they arrived therefore in their council place its
lords Xibalba.
They were defeated again
Therefore there.

Chiri' k'ut
Xech'akataj wi.

Are' xkitaqej ri b'e Xib'alb'a.
Ta xe'opon k'ut pa ki popob'al rajawal Xib'alb'a.

These first seated ones these,
Merely effigies,
Merely carved wood,
Adorned by Xibalba.

Are' nab'e ku'b'ulel ri',
Xa poy,
Xa ajam che',
Kawutalik kumal Xib'alb'a.

These therefore first they greeted:

Are' k'ut nab'e xkiq'ijila:

Xech'akataj chi
K'ut chiri'.

The manuscript reads puch (also) which is likely a scribal error for puj (pus).

---
They said to the effigy.
“Morning, Seven Death,”
They said again to the carved wood.
Not therefore they prevailed.

“Q'ala, Jun Kame,”
Xecha' chire ri poy.
“Q'ala, Wuqub' Kame,”
Xecha' chik chire ri ajam che'.
Ma k'u xech'akowik.

Then therefore they roared its lords Xibalba with laughter. K'ate k'ut xejumujub' rajawal Xib'alb'a chi tze'.
Merely they roared again with laughter all lords,
Xa kejumin chik chi tze' konojel ajawab',
Because they completely prevailed,
In their hearts they defeated

Rumal xech'akomajik,
Chi ki k'u'x xkich'ak

The One Hunahpu,
Seven Hunahpu.

Ri Jun Junajpu,
Wuqub' Junajpu.

They laughed surely.
Then therefore they spoke now,

Xetze'n na.
K'ate k'ut xech'aw chik,

One Death,
Seven Death:

Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame:

“Good then that,
You arrived.

“Utz b'a la',
Mi xixulik.

Tomorrow you will put down its face your yokes,
Your arm protectors,” they were told therefore.

Chuwe'q chiqasa' u wach i b'ate,
I pach' q'ab',” xe'uchax k'ut.

“Sit on our bench,” they were told.
Alone therefore very hot stone their bench was given.

“Kixku'loq chi qa tem,” xe'uchaxik.
U tukel k'u k'atanalaj ab'aj ki tem xya'ik.

They were burned then therefore on its top bench.
Truly they spun around now on its top bench.

Xek'at chi k'ut chuwi' tem.
Qitzij wi xepiskalij chik chuwi' tem.

Not they found relief,
Truly they jumped up.
Burned their means of sitting.

Mawi xeyakamarik,
Qitzij wi xewalejik.
Xk'at ki ku'lib'al.

Then therefore they laughed again Xibalba.
Their insides hurt from laughter,
It was created its serpent cramp laughter in their hearts.

K'ate k'ut xetze'n chik Xib'alb'a.
Xepichicharik chi tze',
Xwinaqirije'ik u kumatz tze' chi ki k'u'x.

They would grab themselves,
They would roll themselves with laughter,

“Merely go to house.

“Xa jix chi ja.

Your torch,
Your cigars,

At sleeping place,”
They were told therefore.

Chi warab'al,”
Xe'uchax k'ut.

Then therefore they arrived in Darkness House,
Alone darkness its interior then house.

K'ate k'ut xe'oponik pa Q'equ'ma Ja,
U tukel q'equ'm u pam chi ja.

Then they gathered therefore their thoughts Xibalba:
“Merely we sacrifice them tomorrow.

Ta xkik'am k'ut ki na'oj Xib'alb'a:
“Xa keqapusu chuwe'q.

Merely mistake straightaway,
Straightaway they die,

Xa lab'e ju su,
Ju su kekamik,

Because of the our gaming things,
The our ballgame things,”

Rumal ri qetz'ab'al,
Ri qa cha'jib'al,”

They say therefore the Xibalbans
To each other.

Kecha' k'u ri Xib'alb'a

This therefore the their ball,
Merely round blade.

Are' k'u ri ki cha'j,
Xa k'olok'ik cha.

White Dagger its name the ball,
Its ball Xibalba.

They entered therefore
The One Hunahpu,
Seven Hunahpu,

Xe'ok k'ut

---

Chupan ri Q'equ'ma Ja.

Then went therefore to give their torch.
Merely one torch lit already.

Ta xb'e k'u ya'oq ki chaj.
Xa jun chi chaj tzijom chik.

It went out with One Death,
Seven Death.

Xel ruk' Jun Kame,

Merely only its face will arrive to gather them,
They say lords to you,”

Xa wi xere u wach chul ki molob'a',
Kecha' ajawab' chiwe,”

They were told.
They were defeated therefore.

Xe'uchaxik.
Xech'akataj k'ut.

The manuscript reads zihom. The tz/z substitution is common in the manuscript.

The mansucript reads tzihon. This may not be a scribal error as the m/n substitution is rather common.

The agent here is not specified. This passage would normally include an –umal (by), indicating the agent, at the end of the sentence
(Mondloch, personal communication).

---
Xkik'is ri chaj,
They finished therefore the cigars one went to give to them. Xkik'is k'u ri sik' xb'e ya'o chike.
Crowded therefore the its trials Xibalba,
Many kinds of trials.

Cut off his head the One Hunahpu.

“Chiya' ri u jolom xo'l che'

Then went therefore to place his head in midst tree,

There was no its fruit,
Maja b'i u wach,
Until placed the his head the One Hunahpu in its midst tree. Maja' ch'oko ri u jolom ri Jun Junajpu chuxo'l che'.
This therefore the calabash tree we say now.
His head One Hunahpu it is said.

Because straightaway he did it,
When entered his head One Hunahpu in its midst.

Rumal ju su xub'anik,

They said therefore the Xibalbans
To each other:

Xecha' k'u ri Xib'alb'a

“Not there be cutting its fruit,
Not there be also entering out below tree,” they said.

“Ma k'o mach'upuwik ri u wach,

They restricted themselves,
They restrained themselves Xibalba all.

Not therefore clear now the his head One Hunahpu.
Merely identical now with its fruit tree.

Ma k'u q'alaj chi ri u jolom Jun Junajpu.

The calabash tree its name it came to be.

I hear,”
She said therefore.

Kanuta'o,”
Xcha' k'ut.

Then she went merely alone,
She arrived therefore

K'ate xb'ek xa u tukel,
Xopon k'ut

Below tree planted,
At Crushing Ballcourt planted.

Chuxe' che' tikil,
Chi Puk'b'al Cha'j tikil wi.

“Ah! What is its fruit this tree?
Is it not delicious it would bear fruit this tree?

“Ji'a'! Naqi pe u wach wa'e che'?
Maki pa kus chiwachin wa' che'?

Not I die,
Not I am lost.

Ma kikam taj,
Ma kisach taj.

Would it be heard should I cut one?”
She said therefore the maiden.

La kata xchinch'up junoq?”
Xcha' k'u ri q'apoj.

Then spoke therefore the skull,
It is there in midst tree:

Ta xch'aw k'ut ri b'aq,
K'o ula xo'l che':

“What do you desire to this?
“Naqi pa karayij chire ri'?

Merely skull this round thing placed in its branches trees,” Xa b'aq ri' k'olok'oxinaq chuq'ab' taq che',”
Said the his head Hunahpu,
When he spoke to the maiden.

Xcha' ri u jolom Junajpu,
Ta xch'awik chire ri q'apoj.

“Not you desire it,”
She was told.

“Ma karayij,”
Xuchaxik.

In this case wila' (see it) is added to the verb -na'oj (to know/understand) to suggest the idea of going to see something in order to
understand it. In modern K'iche', this is more commonly done by adding the suffix –mpe' (example, chawilampe'—“look at it so you’ll
know what it is”).

The manuscript reads xapon.

The manuscript reads quita, likely a scribal error for cata.

---
Said therefore the maiden.

“Kanurayij,”
Xcha' k'ut ri q'apoj.

“Good then that, stretch out hither the your right hand,
I would see it surely,” said the skull.

“Utz b'a la', chalik'ib'a' uloq ri a wikiq'ab',
Wila' na,” xcha' ri b'aq.

“Fine,”
Said therefore maiden.

“We',”
Xcha' k'u q'apoj.

She stretched out upward
Her right hand before its face skull.

Xulik'ib'a' aq'anoq
U wikiq'ab' chuwach b'aq.

Then therefore he would squeeze out,
He makes its saliva skull.

K'ate k'ut chipitz',
Kab'an u chub' b'aq.

Then it came directed therefore
Onto her hand maiden.

Ta xpetik taqal k'ut
Pu q'ab' q'apoj.

Then she looked at it therefore in her hand,
Straightaway she examined it.

Ta xril k'ut u pu q'ab',
Ju suk' xunik'oj.

It was not therefore its saliva skull in her hand.
“Merely its sign I gave to you,

Ma k'u ja b'i' u chub' b'aq pu q'ab'.
“Xa retal mi xnuya' chawe,

The my saliva,
My spittle.

Ri nu chub',
Nu k'axaj.

This the my head does not function now,
Merely skull there is not now its work.

Are' ri nu jolom maja b'i kachoko'n chi wi,
Xa b'aq maja b'i chi u chak.

Merely like his head if truly great lord,
Merely its flesh good his face.

Xa wi keje' u jolom we qi nim ajaw,
Xa u tio'jil utz wi u wach.

This therefore then he will die,
They will be frightened people because of his bones.

Are' k'ut ta chikamik,

Thus merely his son,
Like the his saliva,

Keje' k'ut xa u k'ajol,

His spittle,
His essence.

Merely they shall remain his daughters,
His sons.

Then be it so,
As I did to you.

Climb up therefore there on its face earth,
Not you die.

Kataq'an k'ut chila' chuwach ulew,

Then be it so,”

Katok pa tzij.

Said the his head One Hunahpu,
Seven Hunahpu.

Xcha' ri u jolom Jun Junajpu,

Merely their thought then they did it.
This their word

Thus her return again maiden
To her home.

Keje' k'u u tzalijik chik q'apoj

Many instructions
Were said to her.

Her children in her womb

This therefore their creation

Ju su k'u xwinaqir

Hunahpu,

Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Then arrived therefore at her home the maiden.
Completed therefore six moons,

Ta xopon k'ut chi rochoch ri q'apoj.
Xtz'aqat k'ut waqib' ik',

Then it was noticed by her father.
The Gathered Blood his name her father.

Ta xnawachil rumal u qajaw.
Ri Kuchuma Kik' u b'i' u qajaw.

THEN also her discovery maiden by her father,
Then he saw the her child exists now.

K'ATE puch u natajik q'apoj rumal u qajaw,
Ta xil ri ral k'o chik.

Then they gathered therefore
Their thoughts all lords,

Ta xkikuch k'ut
Ki na'oj konojel ajawab',

One Death,
Seven Death with the Gathered Blood.

Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame ruk' ri Kuchuma Kik'.

“This the my daughter is with her child you lords,
Merely her fornication,”

“Are' ri nu me'al k'o chi ral ix ajawab',

Said therefore the Gathered Blood,
When he arrived with lords.

Xcha' k'u ri Kuchuma Kik',
Ta xoponik kuk' ajawab'.

“Good then that, dig at her mouth this.
When not she tells,

“Utz b'a la', chak'oto' u chi' ri'.
Ta ma kub'ij,

She will be sacrificed therefore,
To far she will go to be sacrificed.”

Chipus k'ut,
Chi najt chib'e pusu wi.”

“Good then that, ye lords,”
He said therefore.

“Utz b'a la', alaq ajawab',”
Xcha' k'ut.

Then therefore he asked

K'ate k'ut xutz'onoj

The manuscript reads vacaquib, likely a scribal error for vaquib.

---
“Who owner the your child
That is in your womb,
You my daughter?”
He said therefore.

Chirech u me'al:
“Apa aj choq'e ri awal
K'o chapam,
At nu me'al?”
Xcha' k'ut.

“There is no my child thou my father,
There is no man I know his face,” she said therefore.

“Maja b'i wal lal nu qajaw,
Maja b'i achij weta'm u wach,” xcha' k'ut.

“Good then that,
True that you scratcher knee.”

“Utz b'a la',
Qitzij wi chi at joxol ch'ek.”

“Sacrifice her,
You their councilors warriors.

“Chipusu',
Ix raj pop achij.

Bring hither the her heart inside bowl,
They will examine it lords this day,”

Chik'ama' uloq ri u k'u'x chupan sel,
Chikitzololej ajawab' wakamik,”

They were told therefore the owls,
They four.

Xe'uchax k'ut ri tukur.
E kajib'.

Then they went carrying the bowl,
Then they went holding in arms the maiden.

Ta xeb'ek ki tik'em ri sel,
Ta xeb'ek ki ch'elem ri q'apoj.

They take the White Dagger,
Instrument of sacrifice of her.

Kuk'a'am ri Saqi Toq',
Pusb'al re.

“Not will be successful you kill me you messengers,
Because not my fornication

“Mawi chutzinik kinikamisaj ix samajel,
Rumal mawi nu joxb'al

This that is in my womb.
Merely was created.

Ri' k'o chi nu pam.
Xaqi xwinaqirik.

Only I went to admire the his head One Hunahpu,
That is at Crushing Ballcourt.

Xere xb'e nu mayijaj ri u jolom Jun Junajpu,
K'o chi Puk'b'al Cha'j.

Cease then therefore,
Not you sacrifice me you messengers,”

K'ek'e ta k'ut,
Mawi kinipus, ix samajel,”

The manuscript reads chiquicololej (to place, set apart), which does not fit the context or syntax of the sentence. It is likely a scribal
error for chiquitzololej, matching the phrase in line .

The manuscript reads quipus, likely a scribal error for quinipus (Mondloch, personal communication).

---
When she spoke.

Xcha' ri q'apoj
Ta xch'awik.

“What shall we use
Its substitute the your heart?

“Naqi pa xchiqakoj
U k'exel ri i k'u'x?

It was said hither,
By your father:

Mi xb'ix uloq,
Rumal a qajaw:

‘Bring hither the her heart,
They shall examine it lords,
They shall be satisfied,
They shall equate its form.
Quickly bring hither in bowl,

‘Chik'am uloq ri u k'u'x,
Xchikitzololej ajawab',
Xchikitz'aqix taj,
Xchikijunamwachij u tz'aqik.
Chanim chik'ama' uloq pa sel,

Place down her heart inside bowl.’
Were not we told hither?
What is it therefore
We shall give in bowl?

Chik'olob'a' qajoq u k'u'x chupan sel.’
Ma pa mi xojuchax uloq?
Naqi la' k'ut
Xchiqaya' pa sel?

We want then first not then you die,”
They said therefore the messengers.

Kaqaj ta nab'ek ma ta katkamik,”
Xecha' k'u ri samajel.

“Good then that, not theirs the heart then be it so,
With it not here your homes will become.

“Utz b'a la', mawi kech ri k'u'x ta chuxoq,
Ruk' mawi waral iwochoch chuxik.

Not therefore merely you will lure by force people
That will die.

Ma k'u xa chichi'j winaq

Then truly yours the true fornicator.
Then also theirs

K'ate qitzij iwech ri qitzij joxol.
K'ate nay pu rech

One Death,
Seven Death,

Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame,

Merely sap,
Merely croton theirs.

Xa kik',
Xa jolomax rech.

The manuscript reads i qux (your [second person plural] heart), rather than a qux (your [second person singular] heart). This form of
address is sometimes used in the text as a means of showing respect, although later in this passage the maiden is addressed by the owls
using the more familiar second person singular form, thus this may simply be a scribal error.

The root words in this parallel triplet-- tzololej, tz'aqixtax, and tz'aqik-- may have been chosen for their alliterative quality.

---
This you will burn before their faces.
Not this the heart you will burn before their faces,
Then be it so.

Ta chuxoq,
Are' chik'at chuwach.
Mawi are' ri k'u'x chik'at chuwach,
Ta chuxoq.

Place the its fruit tree,”
Said therefore the maiden.

Chikojo' ri u wach che',”
Cha' k'ut ri q'apoj.

Red therefore its secretions the tree came out,
It was collected in a bowl.

Kaq k'ut u wa'l ri che' xelik,
Xk'ol pa sel.

Then also it congealed,
Round it became.

K'ate puch xuwon rib',
K'olok'ik xuxik.

Its substitute her heart then squeezed out now therefore,
Its secretions red tree.
Like the blood its secretions tree came out,
Its substitute her blood.

U k'exel u k'u'x ta yitz' chi k'ut,
U wa'l kaq che'.
Keje' ri kik' u wa'l che' xelik,
U k'exel u kik'el.

Then she collected there the sap inside,
The its secretions red tree.
Thus the blood its surface became,
Bright red now collected now in bowl.

Ta xuk'olo chila' ri kik' chupan,
Ri u wa'l kaq che'.
Keje' k'u ri kik' rij xuxik,
Kaqlujluj chik k'olom chi pa sel.

When cut therefore the tree by maiden,
Sacrifice Red Tree it is called.

Ta xqop k'ut ri che' rumal q'apoj,
Chuj Kaq Che' chuchaxik.

This therefore the blood she named it,
Because blood croton it is called.

Are' k'u ri kik' xub'i'naj,
Rumal kik' jolomax chuchaxik.

“There therefore you are esteemed,
On its face earth there is yours it will become,”

“Chila' k'ut kixloq'ox wi,
Chuwach ulew k'o iwech chuxik,”

She said therefore
To the owls.

Xcha' k'ut
Chike ri tukur.

“Good then that,
You maiden.

“Utz b'a la',
At q'apoj.

The manuscript reads chicut, which is apparently a scribal error for chicat.

The manuscript reads xcul, likely a scribal error for xcol as in line  (Mondloch, personal communication).

To hide you upwards,

Merely we go out us,

Before their faces lords,”

U wa u k'exewach a k'u'x

They said therefore
The messengers.

Xecha' k'ut
Ri samajel.

Then they arrived therefore before their faces lords,
They wait expectantly all of them.

Ta xopon k'ut chikiwach ajawab',
Ketz'elewachin konojel.

“Not was successful?”
Said therefore One Death.

“Mawi xutzinik?”
Xcha' k'ut Jun Kame.

“It was successful,
You lords.

“Mi xutzinik,

This surely therefore her heart.
Bottom it is in bowl.”

Wa' na k'u u k'u'x.
Xe' k'o pa sel.”

“Good then that,
I shall see therefore,”

“Utz b'a la',
Wila' k'ut,”

Said therefore the One Death.
Then he lifted it with his fingers therefore upwards,

Xcha' k'u ri Jun Kame.
Ta xuchuyej k'u aq'anoq,

It dripped its surface with flowing blood,
Red bright its surface with blood.

Katurur rij chi komaj,

“Good stir its face fire,
Give it over fire,” said therefore One Death.

“Utz chilu' u wach q'aq',
Chiya' chuwi' q'aq',” xcha' k'ut Jun Kame.

Then also they dried it over fire,
Fragrant therefore they smelled it Xibalba.

K'ate puch xkichaqij chuwi' q'aq',
K'ok' k'ut xkina' Xib'alb'a.

They finished rising hither all of them,
They were bent over it.

Xek'is yakataj uloq konojel,
Xechiqe chuwi'.

---
The its smoke blood.

Qitzij chi kus xkina'o,
Ri u sib'el kik'.

These therefore bent over left behind,
Then they went the owls guides of maiden.

Are' k'ut e chiqichoj wi kanoq,
Ta xeb'e ri tukur e wab'ay rech q'apoj.

They gave her up to hole on its top earth.
Returned then therefore down the guides.

Xukiya' aq'anoq chi jul chuwi' ulew.
Xtzalij chi k'u qajoq ri wab'anel.

Thus they were defeated its lords Xibalba.
This because of maiden were blinded faces all of them.

Keje' k'ut xech'akataj wi rajawal Xib'alb'a.
Ri' rumal q'apoj xemoywachixik konojel.

THIS therefore there is the their mother
One Batz,
One Chouen.
When she arrived the woman,
Lady Blood her name.
When she arrived therefore the woman
Lady Blood
With the their mother
One Batz,
One Chouen.

Then arrived
Therefore the woman
To the grandmother.
Said therefore the woman
To the grandmother:
“I have arrived,

She said when she entered hither

Xcha' ta xok uloq

“From where do you come hither?
There are now the my children?

“Apa katpe wi uloq?

She was told the maiden
By grandmother.

Xuchax ri q'apoj

“But it true that I

“Xere la' qitzij wi chi in

What are surely his.

Wuqub' Junajpu.

Merely their self-manifestation light
They did it thou my mother-in-law.

Xa u k'utb'al rib' saq
Mi xkib'ano lal walib'.

This is the perfect form of the verb uk'a'axik, but for this verb, and other durative verbs, the meaning of the perfect is that the action
began sometime in the past relative to the time spoken of, and continues up to that time. Thus in this context, the meaning is “I am
carrying,” rather than “I have carried” (Mondloch, personal communication).

The manuscript reads catbal (impediment), which is likely a scribal error for cutbal (manifestation).

---
When you shall see his face

Keje' k'ut iwila',
Ta chiloq u wach

This I am carrying,”
She was told the grandmother.

Ri wuk'a'am,”
Xuchaxik ri ati't.

This therefore they glory in the Hun Batz,
Hun Chouen,

Are' k'ut keq'aq'al ri Jun B'atz',

Merely writing,
Merely also carving their work on every day.

They therefore comforters her heart the grandmother.
She said then therefore grandmother,

Are' k'ut ku'b'ul wi u k'u'x ri ati't.
Xcha' chi k'ut ati't,

“Not I want you.
You not my daughter-in-law.

“Xma kawaj wi.

Merely your fornication,
This that is in your womb.

You deceiver.
They died,

At k'axtok'.

She said again therefore the grandmother.

Xcha' chi k'ut ri ati't.

“Truly then his,
This I say to you.”

“Qitzij ib'a re,

“Good then that,

“Utz b'a la',

Go then to it.
Go to get

Jat b'a la'.
Ja' k'ama'

Their food,
That they may eat.

Kecha' wi,
Chikiwa'ej.

The manuscript reads vhat, which is impossible grammatically and is likely a scribal error.

---
May it come,

Ja' jach'a jun chi nima k'at,

You surely therefore my daughter-in-law I hear you,”
She was told therefore the maiden.

At na k'u walib' kanuta'o,”
Xuchax k'ut ri q'apoj.

“Good then that,”
She said therefore.

“Utz b'a la',”
Xcha' k'ut.

Then also then she went to maizefield,
There was their maizefield

K'ate puch ta xb'ek pa ab'ix,

She began it therefore maiden,
She arrived also,

Xutaqej k'ut q'apoj,

In maizefield.

Merely therefore one head the maize plant.
There was not another head,

Then was finished therefore
Her heart the maiden.

“See I sinner!

Then she took therefore
The corn silk,
Its corn silk its top ear of ripe maize,
She pulled it out upward.

Ta xuk'am k'ut
Ri tzami'y,
U tzami'yal u wi' jal,
Xub'oq aq'anoq.

Not she picked the ear of maize.
It abounded therefore the ear of maize,

Mawi xujach' ri jal.
Chikaw k'ut ri jal,

Food in net,
It overflowed the great net.

Echa' pa k'at,

Then she came therefore the maiden,
Merely therefore animals
Carried the net.
When she came,

Ta xpe k'ut ri q'apoj,

Ta xpetik,

They went to give her pack frame.
She perspired like she carried it.

Xb'e ki ya' u ko'k.

She arrived,
She saw the grandmother.

Xoponik,
Xril ri ati't.

Then also when she saw the grandmother the food,
One great netful.

K'ate puch ta xril ri ati't ri echa',

“Where came the food by you,

“Apa mi xpe wi ri echa' awumal,

---

Mi xe'elaq'alab'a' wi?

If finished you brought hither the our maizeplant,
I will go surely to see,” said the grandmother.

We mi xk'is a k'am uloq ri qab'ix,
Chib'e na wila',” xcha' ri ati't.

Then she went also,
She went to see the maizefield.

Ta xb'e puch,
Xb'e rila ri ab'ix.

Merely only there was the one head maizeplant,
Merely therefore only clear its place net beneath.

Xa wi xere k'o wi ri ju wi' ab'ix,
Xa wi k'u xere q'alaj u k'olib'al k'at chuxe'.

Quickly then therefore she came the grandmother,
She arrived then therefore at her home.

Anim chi k'ut xpe ri ati't,
Xul chi k'ut chi rochoch.

She said then therefore
To the maiden:

Xcha' chi k'ut
Chire ri q'apoj:

“Only its sign this
True that you my daughter-in-law.

“Xere wi retal ri'

Then she found its day
Their birth,

Ta xuriq u q'ij
Kalaxik,

Then she gave birth also the maiden,
Lady Blood her name.

Ta xalan puch ri q'apoj,
Xkik' u b'i'.

This is a very difficult word to interpret. The manuscript reads xealcalaba, which is meaningless from the standpoint of any known
Colonial source or from current usage. Mondloch (personal communication) suggests that it may be xe'elaqataja (where did it get stolen
from) which is a much better reading for this context. If this is correct, it would be a scribal error of multiple letters, particularly in the
suffix of the verb. I have chosen to leave the suffix as it appears in the manuscript.

---
When they were born.

Ma k'u xuwachij ati't,
Ta xe'alaxik.

Suddenly then they arose,
They two were born,

Lib'aj chi xeyake'ik,

In mountain they arose,
Then they entered therefore in house.

Not therefore they sleep.
“Go to abandon them,

Ma k'u kewarik.
“Je' a tzaqa uloq,

Truly screaming their mouths,”
Said the grandmother.

They died then also upon thorns.

Xekam ta chiri' pa sanik,

Merely therefore flute,
Merely also song,

There is not then their birds they bring,
They entered hither.

Maja b'i chik ki tz'ikin kuk'a'am,

They will go then
To get down hither the birds,” they said therefore .

Chikaj ta pu ri qatz
Keb'e ta quk'.
Chib'e ta

Ix is normally the second person plural pronoun form. In this case it is used as a formal or respectful type of address for the
grandmother.

---
We go with you
At dawn,”
They said therefore the their older brothers.

“Utz b'a la'.
Kojb'e iwuk'

Xecha' k'u ri katz.

Then they defeated them.
They were received therefore
Their thoughts each of them
To their defeat,

They its womb our words,
Then be it so.

E u pam qa tzij,

Because great affliction
They did to us.

Only its sign we will make,”
They said to each other.

Yellow Tree its name,
To accompany therefore the their older brothers.

Ta xeb'e k'ut

Q'an Te' u b'i',
Kachb'ilan k'u ri katz.

Te' is the Lowland Maya equivalent for the K'iche' che' (tree).

---
Not counted birds in its top tree.

Ta xeb'ek xkitikib'a' chi k'ut wub'anik.
Mawi ajilan chi tz'ikin chuwi' che'.

They would sing riotously,
They were amazed therefore the their older brothers,

When they saw the birds.
These therefore the birds,

There is not one fell hither beneath tree.
“These our birds do not fall hither.

Maja b'i junoq xqaj uloq chuxe' che'.
“Ri' qa tz'ikin e mawi keqaj uloq.

Merely go to bring them down hither,”
They said therefore to their older brothers.
“Good then that,” they said therefore.
Then also they climbed up to its top tree.

Xa jix qasaj uloq,”
Xecha' k'ut chire katz.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut.

Not therefore good now their coming down hither from

K'ate k'ut xeraj qaj uloq,

They said therefore hither from its top tree:
“How do we say it,

Xecha' k'u uloq chuwi' che':
“Jupacha kojucha'nik,

Pity our faces.
This the tree is frightening now we see it,

They said hither from its top tree.
They said therefore the

“Untie your loincloths,
Tie them below your bellies.

Pull out end behind you.

“Fine,” they said therefore,
Then they pulled out therefore its end their loincloths.

“We',” xecha' k'ut,

Merely also straightaway their tails now they became,
Merely spider monkeys they appeared like now.

Xa pu ju su ki je' chi xuxik,

Then therefore they went to its top trees
Small mountains,
Great mountains,
They went into forests.

K'ate k'ut xeb'e chuwi' taq che'

Xeb'ek pa taq k'iche'laj.

They howled now,
They chattered noisily now in its branches trees.

Thus their defeat One Batz,
One Chouen,

Keje' k'ut ki ch'akatajik Jun B'atz',

By Hunahpu,

Kumal Junajpu,

Merely new their faces.

“Ix qati't naqi la' mi xkik'ulwachij ri qatz,

The manuscript reads zilah (be silent) for what should likely be ziloh (to make loud noises like an animal)

---
They said therefore.

Mi xeb'ek keje' ri' e chikop chik,”
Xecha' k'ut.

“If something you did
To them your older brothers,
You caused me misery,
Also you caused me anguish.
Not then like it you did

Said the grandmother

Ix wi'y,”
Xcha' ri ati't

To Hunahpu,

They said now therefore to their grandmother:
“Do not grieve you our grandmother.

Xecha' chi k'ut chire kati't:
“Mixb'isonik ix qati't.

Xere chi k'ut u tijowik

The One Batz,
One Chouen,
They dance when they arrived.

Ta xe'ok k'u uloq

Then also when she looked the grandmother,
Ugly their faces she saw grandmother.

K'ate puch ta xmuqun ri ati't,
Itzel ki wach xril ati't.

Then she laughed,
Not she held back her laughter grandmother.

Ta xtze'nik,

Merely therefore straightaway they went,
Not were seen again their faces.

Xa k'u ju su xeb'ek,

They got up,
They went into forest.

E yakatik,

“What will you do,

Immediately now she laughed again

Paunchy below their bellies,
Naked below also at its edges their chests.

She would laugh grandmother.
Then they went again into mountains.

“What truly will we do you our grandmother?

They dance.
Merely therefore she would contain her laughter the their

Puckered their mouths,
Bushy their mouths.

Mutzuma'q ki chi',
Chik'imal ki chi'.

Their faces silly,
They snort at them.

Then burst out again her laughter the their grandmother.

Ta xril chi k'ut ri ati't,
K'ate xpoq'olij chi u tze' ri kati't.

Not again therefore were seen before their faces,
Because of her laughter grandmother.

Ma chi k'u xil chikiwach,

“Only therefore this you our grandmother,
We shall instruct them thither.”
Its fourth time therefore
They were played the flutes again.
Not therefore they arrived again

Straightaway they went into forest.
They said therefore to their grandmother:

Aj b'ix,

The ancient people.
They also would call,

Ri ojer winaq.
Are' puch chusik'ij,

The writers,
Carvers.

Ri aj tz'ib',
Aj k'ot.

Anciently they became animals,
Spider monkeys they became,

Ojer xechikopirik,
E k'oy xe'uxik,

Because merely they aggrandised themselves,
They abused the their younger brothers.

Rumal xa xkinimarisaj kib',
Xkiyoq' ri ki chaq'.

Thus misery to their hearts,
Thus their ruin this,

Keje' wi q'alab'il chi ki k'u'x,

When they were lost,
The One Batz,
One Chouen.
Animals they became.

There is their home now.

Are' k'ut e ramaq'elal,

Great again they did it,
When they dwelt

Nim chik xkib'ano,

With their grandmother,
With also their mother.

Ruk' rati't,
Ruk' pu ki chuch.

THEN they began again therefore their deeds,
Their self manifestations,

TA xkitikib'a' chi k'ut ki b'anoj,
Ki k'utb'al kib',

Before her face their grandmother,
Before her face also their mother.

Chuwach kati't,
Chuwach pu ki chuch.

The manuscript reads cchoch, which is likely a scribal error for cochoch

---
“Merely we farm maizefield,

Nab'e xkib'ano ri ab'ix.
“Xa kojab'ixik,

You our grandmother,
You also our mother,” they said.

Ix qati't,

“Do not grieve, we are here,
We thy grandchildren.

“Mixb'isonik, oj k'olik,

We their substitutes
Our older brothers,”

Oj ki k'exel

They said therefore the Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xecha' k'u ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Then they took therefore their axes,
Their hoes they were carrying on their shoulders.

Ta xkik'am k'ut ki kaj,
Ki mixk'ina' ki xokem,

They went with each one
Their blowguns they shouldered,
They left their home.

Xeb'ek ruk' jujun
Ki wub' xkitelej,
Xe'el chi kochoch.

Then they instructed therefore their grandmother to her
To give their food.
“At middle surely day
Go to give our food
You grandmother,” they said.

Ta xkipixab' k'u kati't chire
U ya'ik ki wa.
“Chitik'oj na q'ij
Chib'e ya' qa wa

“Good then that you my grandsons,”
Said therefore the their grandmother.

“Utz b'a la' ix wi'y,”
Xcha' k'ut ri kati't.

Then therefore they arrived there,
They farm the maizefield.

K'ate k'ut xe'opon chiri',
Ke'ab'ix wi.

Merely truly they stuck the hoe in earth,
Merely therefore truly it would plow the hoe in earth,
Merely therefore truly it would plow the hoe by itself.

Xa qi xkich'ikib'a' ri mixk'ina' pu ulew,
Xa k'u qi chitajin ri mixk'ina' pu ulew,
Xa k'u qi chitajin ri mixk'ina' chutukel.

This therefore the axe,

Are' k'u ri ikaj,

The manuscript has ma (not), which must be a scribal error from the context of this passage.

---
Merely its own strength tree it would fell.

Xa wi chikich'ikib'a' chutolok' che',
Xa wi chuq'ab' rib' che' chib'ek.

It would chop,
It would fell

Chilajajik,
Chib'ek

All trees,
Bushes.

Ronojel che',
K'a'am.

Feverishly now
It would cut down trees.

Kaqchakachoj chik
Chiq'atoj che'.

It would do it the merely one axe.
This therefore the hoe thick it would break up,

Chub'an ri xa juna ikaj.
Are' k'u ri mixk'ina' tzatz chiq'upuj,

Not counted stalks briars does the merely one hoe,
Not counted breaking up.

Mawi ajilan tum k'ixik kub'an ri xa jun chi

Mawi ajilan q'upuj.

Merely small mountains,
Great mountains it goes.

Xa ch'uti juyub',
Nima juyub' kab'ek.

Then they instructed therefore an animal,
Turtle Dove its name.

Ta xkipixab'aj k'ut jun chikop,
Xmukur u b'i'.

They placed it up
On its top great stump.

Xkit'uyub'a' aq'anoq
Chuwi' nima kuta'm.

They spoke therefore Hunahpu,
Xbalanque:

Xecha' k'ut Junajpu,
Xb'alanke:

“Merely you will see the our grandmother will come to
give our food,
Straightaway you cry out when she has come.

“Xa chawil ri qati't chipetik ya'ol qa wa,

Then therefore we will grasp the hoe,
With axe.”

K'ate k'ut chiqachap ri mixk'ina',
Ruk' ikaj.”

“Good then that,”
Said therefore the turtle dove.

“Utz b'a la',”
Xcha' k'u ri xmukur.

This therefore merely blowgun hunting they would do.
Not surely true maize farming then they would do.

Are' k'ut xa wub'anik chikib'ano.
Ma na qitzij ab'ixik ta chikib'ano.

Ju su katoq'ik ta petoq.

---
Quickly therefore they come.

K'ate puch choq' ri xmukur,
Anim k'ut kepetik.

One would grab hoe,
One therefore would grab the axe.

Jun chichapo mixk'ina',
Jun k'ut chichapow ri ikaj.

They would put field debris on their heads,
Without cause he would rub earth on his hands.

Chikipisla ki wi',
Xaloq' chub'aqala' ulew pu q'ab'.

The one merely like he would dirty his face,
Like truly had farmed maizefield.

Ri jun xa keje' chutz'iloj u wach,
Keje' ri' qitzij ab'ixom.

This therefore the one other merely without cause toss its
chips wood on his head,
Like truly cutter tree.

Are' k'u ri jun chik xaloq' chupuk'ij u web'al che'

Keje' wi ri' qitzij q'atoj che'nel.

Then they were seen by their grandmother,
Then therefore they eat.

Ta xil rumal kati't,
K'ate k'ut kewa'ik.

Not true maize farming they would do.
Without cause she would go to give their food.

Ma qitzij ab'ixik chikib'ano.
Xaloq' chib'e ya'oq ki wa.

Then they went therefore to their home.
“Truly we are tired,
You our grandmothers,”
They say they arrive.

Ta xeb'e k'ut chi kochoch.
“Qitzij mi xojkosik,
Ix qati't,”
Kecha' ke'oponik.

Without cause they would rub,
They would stretch out also,

Xaloq' chikikikij,

Ri qab'ix,
Ta xojopon mier ix qati't,”

They said therefore to their grandmother,
To also their mother.

Xecha' k'ut chire kati't,
Chire pu ki chuch.

“We shall go therefore,
We shall watch over it by night,

“Xkojb'e k'ut,

Because not good is done to us,”
They said.

Rumal mawi utz kab'an chiqe,”

Merely one they got together,
Xa jun xkisep wi kib',
All small animals,
Great animals.

Ronojel ch'uti chikop,

This also zenith its heart night when they came.
They chattered all when they came.

Are' puch tik'il u k'u'x aq'ab' ta xepetik.
Xech'awije'ik konojel ta xepetik.

This their speech this:
“Arise trees,
Arise bushes,”
They said when they came.

Are' ki ch'ab'al ri':
“Yaklin che',

Xecha' ta xepetik.

They congregated beneath trees,
Beneath bushes.

Keneb'eb'ik xe' che',

Then they emerged,
Then they appeared therefore again before their faces.

This therefore first the puma,

Are' k'ut u nab'e ri koj,

Not they gave themselves.

Xraj k'u ki chapo,

Then emerged again deer,

Merely therefore by their tails they grabbed them,
Merely therefore they were broken off.

They passed by,
All animals,

Xe'ik'owik,
Konojel chikop,

Before their faces Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Troubled then therefore their hearts,
Because this there was nothing they caught.

Came therefore this one more,
Last going now,

This also his eyes,
When was wanted to strangle him by boys,

Are' nay pu u b'aq' u wach,
Ta xraj b'iyik kumal k'ajolab',

The Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

“Not then I die by you,
Not this your task the maize farming

“Ma ta kikamik iwumal.

There is yours,” said this the rat.
“Where is ours?

“Will you release me then first?
There is my word in my belly,

“La kinitzoqopij ta na b'a la'?

Then therefore I will tell it to you,
You will give then first a little my food,” said the rat.
“After we will give you your food.

Greatly rejoiced their hearts when they heard its news

This therefore the his food:

He was told therefore the rat by Hunahpu,

Xuchax k'u ri ch'o kumal Junajpu,

“Good then that,

“Utz b'a la',

“Not may it fall your heart,
We are here.

“Mawi chitzaq a k'u'x,

There is to be told the our grandmother.

Merely straightaway we give you up corner house,
Then therefore to fetch out,

Xa ju su kaqaya' aq'anoq xikin ja,
Ta k'u joko apanoq,

Straightaway you arrive there
Where they are hanging.

Ju su katopon chiri'
Xekel wi.

There therefore we see it in its rafters house,
Chiri' k'ut kaqil wi pu tum ja,
Only in our bite to eat we see it,” they said therefore to rat, Xa pa qa ti' kaqil wi,” xecha' k'ut chire ch'o,
When they instructed one night,
Were gathered their thoughts,

Ta xkipixab'aj jun aq'ab',
Xk'am ki na'oj,

The Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Truly therefore zenith sun,
They arrived.

Qi k'u tik'il q'ij,

NOT therefore clear the rat
They carried when they arrived.
One of them arisen entered in to house,
One therefore entered corner house.
Immediately then he put up
The rat.

MA k'u q'alaj ri ch'o
Kuk'a'am ta xe'oponik.
Jun ri' yakalik xok pa ja,
Jun k'u xok xikin ja.
Lib'aj chi xuya' aq'anoq
Ri ch'o.

Then they asked for therefore their food
To their grandmother.
“Merely mash our bite to eat.
We desire the mashed chili peppers,
You our grandmother,”
They said therefore.

Ta xkitz'onoj k'ut ki wa
Chire kati't.
“Xa chiq'utu' qa ti'.
Kaqarayij ri q'utum ik,

Xecha' k'ut.

Then therefore was mashed their bite to eat.
One plate its sauce was placed before their faces.

K'ate k'ut xq'ut ki ti'.
Jun laq u wa'l xtikib'ax chikiwach.

Merely their plucking of their grandmother,
Their mother as well.

Xa wi ki mich'b'al re kati't,
Ki chuch puch.

They drained it dry therefore water in jug.

Xkitzajisaj k'u ja' pa q'eb'al.

“Qitzij chaqi'j qa chi'.

Get our drink,” they said to their grandmother.
“Fine,” she said therefore.

Chik'ama' quk'ia',” xecha' chire kati't.
“We',” xcha' k'ut.

Then she left.
They therefore eat remaining behind.

Ta xb'ek.
Are' k'ut kewa kanoq.

Not therefore true then they are hungry.
Merely their deception they did

Ma k'u qitzij ta kenumik.
Xa ki moywachib'al xkib'ano

Then they saw therefore the rat in mashed chili.
Placed here the rat behind rubber ball
Hanging above house,
Then they saw it in mashed chili.

Ta xkil k'ut ri ch'o chupan q'utum ik.
K'olon uloq ri ch'o chirij kik'
Xekel wi puwi' ja,
Ta xkilo pa q'utum ik.

Then they sent therefore a mosquito.
The insect the mosquito like the small biting fly.

Ta xkitaq k'ut jun xa'n.
Ri chikop ri xa'n keje' ri us.

It arrived at river,
It therefore pierced its face jug grandmother.

Xopon chi ya',
Are' k'u xworo u wach q'eb'al ati't.

Merely raised water it would come out before her jug.
She would try but it would not seal its face jug.

Xa yakal ja' chel chuwach u q'eb'al.
Chutijo xma chitz'apitaj wi u wach q'eb'al.

“What did she do
The our grandmother?

“Naqi pa mi xub'an
Ri qati't?

We are gasping for water!
We are finished by dry mouth!”

Oj jisab'aj chi ya'!
Kojutzin rumal chaqi'j chi'!”

They said again to their mother.
Then they sent her away.

Xecha' chik chire ki chuch.
Ta xkitaq ub'ik.

Then therefore he clawed hither rat
The rubber ball.

K'ate k'ut xuk'aqat ula ch'o
Ri kik'.

It fell hither from thatch house,
With yokes,
Arm protectors,
Leathers.
They were carried away therefore.

Xqaj ula pu tum ja,
Ruk' b'ate,
Pach' q'ab',
Tz'um.
Xkimajix taj k'ut.

---
Its path ballcourt.

K'ate xb'e kewaj pa b'e,
U b'e'el jom.

Then therefore they went again
With their grandmother at river.

K'ate k'ut xeb'e chik
Ruk' kati't chi ya'.

They were busy therefore
The their grandmother,
Their mother
Sealing its face jug each one.

Katajin k'u
Ri kati't,
Ki chuch
Tz'api u wach q'eb'al jujun.

Then therefore when they arrived,
Each therefore with blowgun when they arrived at river.

K'ate k'ut ta xe'oponik,
Jujun chi k'u chi wub' ta xe'oponik chi a'.

“What you did?
Merely tired our hearts,

“Naqi pa mi xib'ano?
Xa mi xkos qa k'u'x,

We came,” they said.
“Look at surely its face my jug.
Not it can be sealed,” said their grandmother.
Immediately then therefore they sealed it again.
Together therefore they came again,

Xojpetik,” xecha'.
“Chiwila' na u wach nu q'eb'al.
Mawi katz'apitajik,” xcha' kati't.
Lib'aj chi k'ut xkitz'apij chik.
Junam k'ut xepe chik,

They first before their grandmother.
Thus its discovery ball this.

E nab'e chuwach kati't.
Keje' k'ut u kana'ik kik' ri'.

THEY rejoice now therefore,
They went as ballplayers to ballcourt.

KEKI'KOT chi k'ut,
Xeb'ek e cha'jel pa jom.

Long time therefore they played ball alone.
They swept the ballcourt their father.

Najt k'u xecha'jik ki tukel.
Xkimes ri jom ki qajaw.

Then they heard it therefore hither its lords Xibalba.
“Someone there started again game above our heads.

Ta xkita k'u uloq rajawal Xib'alb'a.
“Apachina chiri' mi xutikib'a' chik etz'anem pa qa wi'.

Not are as well they ashamed thither,
They stomp about hither?

Ma pu kek'ix b'ik,
Keniknot uloq?

Not did as well they die One Hunahpu,
Seven Hunahpu?

Ma pu xekam ri Jun Junajpu,

They wanted to aggrandise themselves before us.

Xraj ki nimarisaj kib' chi qa wach.

Je' k'u i taqa chik,” xecha' chik,

The One Death,
Seven Death,

Ri Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame,

All lords.
“Summon them hither,”

Konojel ajawab'.
“Xetaqa' uloq,”

They said therefore
To their messengers.

Xecha' k'ut
Chire ki samajel.

“Say, ‘arrive,
They must come, say lords.

“Kixcha', ‘kixoponik,
Kepetoq, kecha' ajawab'.

Here we would play ball with them.
In seven days we play, say the lords.’

Waral taj kojcha'j wi kuk'.
Wuqub'ix kojetz'anik, kecha' ajawab'.’

You tell them when you arrive,”
They were told therefore

Kixcha' kixoponik,”
Xe'uchax k'ut

The messengers.
Then they came therefore.

Ri samajel.
Ta xepe k'ut.

Great cleared pathway therefore
Their road the boys

Nima jok k'u
Ki b'e ri k'ajolab'

To their home,
Until pursued into their home.

Chi kochoch,
K'a toq'ol chi kochoch.

Merely therefore rising the messengers,
They arrived with their grandmother.

Xa k'u yakal ri samajel,
Xopon ruk' kati't.

When therefore they play ball,
Then they came behind its messengers Xibalba.

Are k'ut kecha'jik,
Ta xul kanoq u samajel Xib'alb'a.

“‘Truly they come,’ say the lords,”
They said therefore the its messengers Xibalba.

“‘Qitzij kepetik,’ kecha' ri ajawab',”
Xecha' k'ut ri u samajel Xib'alb'a.

Then was set therefore behind their day
By them the its messengers Xibalba.

Ta xchoye' k'u kanoq ki q'ij
Kumal ri u samajel Xib'alb'a.

“In seven days they are expected,”
She was told behind Xmucane.

“Wuqub'ix ketz'elawachixik,”
Xuchax kanoq Xmuqane.

---
You messengers,” said the grandmother.

“Utz b'a la', xkeb'e taqoq,
Ix samajel,” xcha' ri ati't.

They went therefore the messengers,
They returned.

Xeb'e k'u ri samajel,
Xetzalijik.

Then was finished therefore her heart the grandmother.
“How shall I tell them of

Ta xk'is k'ut u k'u'x ri ati't.
“Naqi xchiwuchaj

Their summons the my grandsons?
Not truly the Xibalbans?

Ki taqik ri wi'y?
Mawi qitzij ri Xib'alb'a?

Merely like their arrival messengers before,
When they went to die the their father,”

Xa keje' rulik samajel ojer,
Ta xeb'e kamoq ri ki qajaw,”

Said the grandmother.
Woefully weeping in house alone.

Xcha' ri ati't.
Q'us choq' pa ja u tukel.

Then therefore fell hither a louse,
It itched.

K'ate k'ut xqaj ulo jun uk',
Chuk'ayaq.

Then therefore she grabbed it up,
Then she put it therefore in hand.

K'ate k'u xuchap aq'anoq,
Ta xuya' k'ut pu q'ab'.

It would scuttle about therefore
The louse walked.

Chimalmatib' k'u
Ri uk' xb'inik.

“You my grandchild,
Would you like

“At wi'y,
Chawaj taj

I send you
To go then to you summon

Kanutaqo
Keb'e ta a taqa'

The my grandsons at ballcourt?”
Was told the louse.

Ri wi'y pa jom?”
Xuchax ri uk'.

Then it went summoner.
“Came messengers with your grandmother,

Ta xb'ek taqonel.
“Mi xul samajel ruk' iwati't,

They say you are to come.
‘In seven days therefore they are to come,’

Kacha' katoponik.
‘Wuqub'ix k'ut ke'oponik,’

---
Your grandmother she says,” was told the louse.

Kacha' u samajel Xib'alb'a, kacha'
Iwati't kacha',” xuchax ri uk'.

Then he went,
Scuttling therefore he went.

Ta xb'ek,
Chimalmat k'ut xb'ek.

Sitting therefore the boy in road,
Tamazul his name the toad.

Ku'b'ul k'u ri k'ajol pa b'e,
Tamasul u b'i' ri xpeq.

“Where you go?” says therefore the toad to louse.
“It is there then,
My word in my belly.
I go with boys,” said the louse to Tamazul.

“Apa katb'e wi?” cha' k'u ri xpeq chire uk'.
“K'o b'a,
Nu tzij chi nu pam.
Kinb'e kuk' k'ajolab',” xcha' ri uk' chire Tamasul.

“Good then that.
Not then you go fast,
I see it,” was told therefore louse by toad.
“Not you would want I swallow you?
You will see surely how fast I go.
We shall arrive quickly.”
“Good then that,” said the louse to toad.

“Utz b'a la'.
Ma b'a katana'ik,
Kawilo,” xuchax k'u uk' rumal xpeq.
“Ma chawaj kanub'iq'o?
Chawila' na pe kinanik wa.
Xkojopon chanim.”
“Utz b'a la',” xcha' ri uk' chirech xpeq.

Then therefore he was licked up by toad.
He goes hopping therefore the toad.

K'ate k'ut ta xriq'taxik rumal xpeq.
Chib'eqnaj k'u ri xpeq.

Then he went now,
Not he goes fast.

Ta xb'ek chi,
Mawi ka'anik.

Then therefore he met now therefore a great snake,
White Life his name.

K'ate k'ut ta xuk'ul chi k'ut jun nima kumatz,
Saqi K'as u b'i'.

“Where you go,
You Tamazul boy?”

“Apa katb'e wi,
At Tamasul k'ajol?”

Was asked again the toad
By White Life.

Xuchax chik ri xpeq
Rumal Saqi K'as.

“I messenger,
It is my word in my belly,”

“In samajel,
K'o nu tzij chi nu pam,”

Said again therefore toad
To snake.

Xcha' chi k'ut xpeq
Chire kumatz.

---
Me then perhaps I shall arrive quickly,”
Said therefore snake
To toad.

“Ma b'a katanik kawilo.
In ta on xkinopon chanim,”
Xcha' k'u kumatz
Chire xpeq.

“Go ahead,”
He was told.

“Katojo',”
Xuchaxik.

Then therefore was swallowed now
The toad by White Life.

K'ate k'u xb'iq' chik
Ri xpeq rumal Saqi K'as.

Then received the his food snake,
They are swallowed toads today.

Ta xuk'am ri recha' kumatz,
Keb'iq'ow xpeq wakamik.

He would go fast therefore the snake,
When he went.

Chan k'u ri kumatz,
Ta xb'ek.

Was met again therefore the snake by falcon,
Great bird.

Xk'ulutaj chi wi k'ut ri kumatz rumal wak,
Nima tz'ikin.

Was swallowed then the snake
By falcon.

Xb'iq' chi wi ri kumatz
Rumal wak.

Then also he arrived this
On its top ballcourt.
When received his food the hawk,
They eat snakes in mountains.
Then he arrived also the falcon,
He alighted on its top its rim ballcourt.

K'ate pu xopon ri'
Chuwi' jom.
Ta xuk'am recha' ri xik',
Keti'ow kumatz pa taq juyub'.
Ta xopon puch ri wak,
Xchakachob' chuwi' u tzutz'il jom.

They rejoice therefore
The Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.
They play ball.

Keki'kot k'u
Ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.
Kecha'jik.

Then he arrived therefore the falcon.
Then cried out therefore the falcon:

Ta xopon k'ut ri wak.
Ta xoq' k'u ri wak:

“Wak-ko! Wak-ko!”
Said his cry falcon strongly.

“Wako! Wako!”
Xcha' roq'ib'al wak ko.

This is likely a play on words. Xuk'am is “received,” while the homophonous xuk'a'am is “carried.” In this case the text explains the
origin of how snakes “received” their principal food, but at the same time this particular snake “carries” the toad bearing the message.

---
May come our blowguns!” they said.

“Naqi pa ri' choq'ik?
Peta' qa wub'!” xecha'.

THEN also they shot the falcon,
It buried itself directed its pellet blowgun in his eye.

K'ATE puch xkiwub'aj ri wak,
Kek'u' taqal u b'aq' wub' chu b'aq' u wach.

He was knocked down therefore,
He fell hither.

Chiselet k'ut,
Xqaj uloq.

Truly therefore they went to grab him.
Then they asked:

Qitzij wi k'ut xb'e ki chapa'.
K'ate xkitz'onoj:

“Why have you come?”
They said to falcon.

“Ju pa a petik?”
Xecha' chire wak.

“There is then my word in my belly.
Cure then surely my eye first,

“K'o b'a nu tzij chi nu pam.
Chikunaj ta na u b'aq' nu wach nab'e,

Then therefore I shall tell it,”
Said the falcon.

K'ate k'ut xchinb'ij,”
Xcha' ri wak.

“Good then that,”
They said therefore.

“Utz b'a la',”
Xecha' k'ut.

Then they took out a little
Its surface rubber the ball.

K'ate xkelesaj sqaqi'n
Rij kik' ri cha'j.

They put it in his face the falcon,
Sliced Rubber it was named by them.

Xkikoj chi u wach ri wak,
Lotz Kik' xub'i'naj kumal.

Immediately then therefore was it cured by them,
Good again his sight the falcon it became.

Lib'aj chi k'ut xkach'oj kumal,
Utz chik u muqub'al ri wak xuxik.

“Tell it therefore,”
They said to falcon.

“Chab'ij k'ut,”
Xecha' chire wak.

Then therefore he vomited great snake.
“Speak,” they said again to snake.

K'ate k'ut xuxawaj nima kumatz.
“Kach'awoq,” xecha' chik chire kumatz.

“Fine,” he said then therefore.
Then he vomited again toad.

“We',” xcha' chi k'ut.
Ta xuxawaj chi xpeq.

---
Speak,”

“Naqi pa a taqikil?
Kattzijonoq,”

Was told then therefore the toad.
Xuchax chi k'u ri xpeq.
“There is then my word in my belly,” said again therefore “K'o b'a nu tzij chi nu pam,” xcha' chi k'u ri xpeq.
the toad.
Then therefore he tried to throw up.
There is not he vomited.
Merely like it would drool his mouth.
He would try it,
But there is nothing he vomits.

K'ate k'ut xutij xab'ik.

Then therefore they wanted he be beaten by boys,
“You deceiver,” he was told.

K'ate k'ut xraj ch'ayik kumal k'ajolab',
“At k'axtok',” xuchaxik.

Then was squashed his rear end with their feet.
Crushed therefore bones his backside with their feet.

Ta xyik' u wa rachaq chi aqan.
Xk'aj k'u b'aqil u wa rachaq chi aqan.

He tried again therefore,
Merely like it would salivate his mouth.

Xutij chi k'ut,
Xa keje' chuchub' u chi'.

Then also they pried open his mouth the toad,
It was pried open by boys.

K'ate puch xkirech' u chi' ri xpeq,
Xrech' kumal k'ajolab'.

They searched in his mouth,
Merely therefore stuck the louse

Xkitzukuj pu chi',
Xa k'u nak'al ri uk'

In front his teeth toad.
Merely in his mouth he is.

Chuwa re' xpeq.
Xa pu chi' k'o wi.

Not surely he swallowed him,
Merely like you swallow.

Ma na xub'iq'o,
Xa keje' xab'iq'.

Thus was defeated the toad,
Not clear its face his food they gave him.

Keje' k'ut xch'akataj wi ri xpeq,
Mawi q'alaj u wach recha' xkiya'o.

With it not he will go fast,
Merely his spoil snake he became.

Ruk' mawi chanik,
Xa u ch'ak kumatz xuxik.

“Speak!”
Was told again therefore the louse.

“Katzijonoq!”
Xuchax chi k'ut ri uk'.

“Says the your grandmother you boys:

Ta xub'ij k'u u tzij.
“Kacha' ri iwati't ix k'ajolab':

‘Go you to summon them.
Arrived summoners of them.

‘Je' a taqa.
Xul taqol ke.

They come from Xibalba,
Their messengers

One Death,
Seven Death.

Wuqub' Kame.

‘In seven days they arrive here,
We play ball.

‘Wuqub'ix ke'ulik waral,

They must come the their gaming things:
Rubber ball,
Yokes,
Arm protectors,
Leathers.

Chipe ri ketz'ab'al:

Tz'um.

They will enliven its face here,’
They say lords.

Are' chik'astaj u wach waral,’
Kecha' ajawab'.

‘Arrived their word,’
Says the your grandmother.

‘Xul ki tzij,’
Kacha' ri iwati't.

‘Then you shall come,’
Truly says the your grandmother.
She weeps,
She calls out,
Your grandmother
That you shall come.”

‘Ta xipetik,’
Qitzij kacha' ri iwati't.
Koq'ik,
Kasik'inik,

Xipetik.”

“Is it not true?” they said therefore boys in their hearts
When they heard it.

“Ma qitzij!” xecha' k'ut k'ajolab' chi ki k'u'x 
Ta xkita'o.

Straightaway they came,
They arrived therefore with their grandmother.

Ju su xepetik,
Xe'opon k'ut ruk' kati't.

Merely advisors to her
Their grandmother

Xa e pixab'ay chire

“WE go surely,
You our grandmothers,
Merely we advisors to you.

Xeb'ek.
“JO' na,

This therefore its sign our word,
We shall leave it behind.

Wa'e k'ute retal qa tzij,

Each of us shall plant to this ear of unripe maize,
In its center our house we shall plant.

Jujun xchiqatik chire wa' aj,
Chu nik'ajal qochoch xchiqatik wi.

This its sign our death
If it will dry up.

Are' retal qa kamik

‘They died,’
You say when it will dry up.

‘Mi pa xekamik,’
Kixcha' ta chichaqijik.

If therefore then it will come up its sprout,
‘They are alive,’ you say therefore,

We k'ut ta chipe u tux,
‘E pa k'aslik,’ kixcha' k'ut,

You our grandmother,
You also our mother.

Ix pu qa chuch.

Do not weep, there is its sign our word,
It is left behind with you,” they said.

Mixoq'ik, k'o retal qa tzij,

Then they went one he planted Hunahpu,
One therefore planted Xbalanque.

Ta xeb'ek jun xutik Junajpu,
Jun chi k'u xtikow Xb'alanke.

Merely in house they planted it.
Not surely in mountains,
Not also in fertile ground,
Merely in dry ground,

Xa pa ja xutik wi.

Ma nay pu pa rax ulew taj.
Xa pa chaqi'j ulew,

In its center its interior their home,
They planted it behind.

Chu nik'ajal u pa kochoch,
Xkitik wi kanoq.

Then they went therefore,
Each blowgun to them.

Ta xeb'e k'ut,
Jujun chi wub' chike.

They descended to Xibalba,
Immediately they descended before steps.

Xeqaj chi Xib'alb'a,
Lib'aj chi xeqaj chuwa kumuk.

Into various river canyons.
Merely in its midst birds
They passed by.

Xe'ik'ow chiwi' k'ut
Chupan jal ja' siwan.
Xa chuxo'l tz'ikin
Xe'ik'ow wi.

These the birds,
Flocks their name.

Are' ri tz'ikin,
Molay ki b'i'.

They passed over again therefore on Pus River,
On Blood River,

Xe'ik'ow chi k'ut pa Puj Ya',
Pa Kik' Ya',

Traps were to be theirs
In their hearts Xibalba.

Ch'akb'al ta ke
Chi ki k'u'x Xib'alb'a.

Not were they troubled.
Merely on their backs blowguns they passed over.

Mawi xkiyikow.
Xa chirij wub' xe'ik'ow wi.

They left again therefore out on four crossroads.
Merely they knew therefore their roads Xibalba:

Xe'el chi k'u apanoq pa kajib' xalkat b'e.
Xa xketa'm wi k'ut ki b'e Xib'alb'a:

Black Road,
White Road,
Red Road,
Blue/Green Road.

Q'eqa B'e,
Saqi B'e,
Kaqa B'e,
Raxa B'e.

There therefore they sent an insect,
Mosquito his name.

Chiri' k'ut xkitaq wi jun chikop,
Xa'n u b'i'.

He obtainer their hearing,
They sent him thither.

Are' k'amol ki ta,
Xkitaq ub'ik.

“Each one of them you bite.
First you will bite
The first seated one.
You will accomplish their biting all of them.

“Jujunal ke'ati'o.
Nab'e chati'
Ri nab'e ku'b'ulel.
Chatz'akonisaj ki ti'ik konojel.

Truly yours therefore you will suck their blood
People on road,” was told the mosquito.

Xawech wi k'ut chatz'ub'aj wi u kik'el
Winaq pa b'e,” xuchaxik ri xa'n.

Ta here indicates intent. Thus the traps were intended to be their defeat but, in fact, they weren’t (Mondloch, personal
communication).

X- wi together act as a modal indicating certainty or a permanent trait: “it is truly yours.” In Nahuala today the equivalent is si- wi
(Mondloch, personal communication).

Then he entered on Black Road,

“Utz b'a la',” xcha' k'u ri xa'n.
Ta xok pa Q'eqa B'e,

Alighted therefore behind them
The effigies carved wood.

Tak'al k'u chirij
Ri poy ajam che'.

First seated ones all dressed up,
First therefore he bit him.

Nab'e ku'lel e kawutalik,
Nab'e k'ut xuti'o.

Not he spoke.
He bit again therefore.
When he bit again second seated one,
Not again he spoke.

Mawi xch'awik.
Xuti' chi k'u.
Ta xuti' chi u kab' ku'lel,
Ma chi wi xch'awik.

He bit again therefore third one,
Now next third seated one is One Death.

Xuti' chi k'u rox,
K'a chi rox ku'lel k'o wi Jun Kame.

“Ouch!”
Said therefore one when he was bitten.

“Aki!”
Xcha' k'ut jun ta xti'ik.

“What?”
“Ow!” said One Death.

“Naqi?”
“Aji!” xcha' Jun Kame.

“What, One Death?
What is it?”

“Naqi, Jun Kame?
Naqi la'?”

“I am being bitten!”
“Merely...Ow! What is there?

“Mi xiti'owik!”
“Xa...aji! Naqi chila'?

I am being bitten!”
Said next fourth seated one.

Mi xiti'owik!”
Xcha' chik u kaj ku'lel.

“What, Seven Death?
What is it?”

“Naqi, Wuqub' Kame?
Naqi la'?”

“I am being bitten!”
Said next fifth seated one.

“Mi xiti'owik!”
Xcha' chi ro' ku'lel.

“Ow! Ow!”
He said surely.

“Aji! Aji!”
Xcha' na.

The manuscript reads xquitio (they bit), which is likely a scribal error for xutio (he bit).

---
Said Seven Death to him,

“Xik'iri Pat,”
Xcha' Wuqub' Kame chire,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

Was bitten sixth seated one.
“Ow!”

“Aji!”

“What, Gathered Blood?”

“Naqi, Kuchuma Kik'?”
Xcha' Xik'iri Pat chire,

“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

Then was bitten seventh seated one.
“Ow!” he said next.

Ta xti' u wuq ku'lel.
“Aji!” xcha' chik.

“What, Demon Pus?”
Said Gathered Blood to him,

“Naqi, Ajal Puj?”
Xcha' Kuchuma Kik' chire,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

Then was bitten eighth seated one.
“Ow!” he said next.

Ta xti' u wajxaq ku'lel.
“Aji!” xcha' chik.

“What, Demon Jaundice?”
Said next Demon Pus to him,

“Naqi, Ajal Q'ana?”
Xcha' chi Ajal Puj chire,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” cha' chik.

Then was bitten next ninth seated one.
“Ow!” he said.

Ta xti' chik u b'elej ku'lel.
“Aji!” xcha'.

“What, Staff Bone?”
Said Demon Jaundice to him,

“Naqi, Ch'ami'ya B'aq?”
Xcha' Ajal Q'ana chire,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

“Ow!”

Ta xti' chik u lajuj ku'b'ulel.
“Aji!”

“What, Staff Skull?”
Said Staff Bone,

“Naqi, Ch'ami'ya Jolom?”
Xcha' Ch'ami'ya B'aq,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

Then was bitten next eleventh seated one.
“Ow!” he said next.

Ta xti' chik u julaj ku'lel.
“Aji!” xcha' chik.

“What, [Wing]?”
Said next Staff Skull to him,

“Naqi, [Xik']?”
Cha' chik Ch'ami'ya Jolom chire,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

Then was bitten next twelfth seated one.
“Ow!” he said next.

Ta xti' chik u kab'lajuj ku'lel.
“Aji!” xcha' chik.

“What, Packstrap?”
Said next [Wing] to him,

“Naqi, Patan?”
Xcha' chik [Xik'] chire,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

Then was bitten next thirteenth seated one.
“Ow!”

Ta xti' chik roxlajuj ku'lel.
“Aji!”

“What, Bloody Teeth?”
Said Packstrap to him,

“Naqi, Kik' [Re'],”
Cha' Patan chirech,

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!” he said next.

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xiti'owik!” xcha' chik.

Then was bitten next fourteenth seated one.

Ta xti' chik u kajlajuj ku'lel.

The manuscript reads julaj, which should be julajuj.

The manuscript does not give the name here, but it should be “Wing” (see line , ).

The manuscript reads quic xic (Bloody Wing), although in line , and in other places, this Xibalba lord is consistently named as
quic re (Bloody Teeth).

---

“Aji!”

“What is it?”
“I am being bitten!”

“Naqi la'?”
“Mi xitiowik!”

Said next Bloody Claws,
Said Bloody Teeth to him.

Xcha' chik Kik' Rixk'aq,
Xcha' Kik' Re' chirech.

Thus its naming their names,
These they named.

Keje' k'ut u b'i'xik ki b'i',
Ri' xkib'i'j.

All of them to each other revealed their faces,
They named their names.

Konojel chi kib'il kib' xkik'ut u wach,
Xkib'i'j ki b'i'.

Each one by rank his naming by them,
It would be named his name the one seated to his side.

Jujun chijoloman u b'i'xik kumal,
Are' chib'i'n u b'i' jun ri ku'b'ul chu xukut.

There is not one they missed his name,
Finished their naming their names all of them

Maja b'i junoq xkisach u b'i',
K'is ki b'i'j ki b'i' konojel

When they were bitten by its hair its front his knee
Hunahpu,
He plucked out.

Ta xeti' rumal rismal u wach u ch'ek

Xumich' ub'ik.

Not surely true mosquito that bit them.
He went to hear their names all of them

Ma na qitzij xa'n ri xeti'owik.
Xb'e ta'o ki b'i' konojel

Because of Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Rumal Junajpu
Xb'alanke.

Then therefore then they went,
Then they arrived as well,

K'ate k'ut ta xeb'ek,
Ta xe'opon puch,

There where they are
Xibalbans.

Chila' e k'o wi

“Hail lords,” he said,
“These seated,” said one tempter.

“Chiq'ijila' ajaw,” xcha',
“Ri' ku'b'ulik,” xcha' jun taqchi'nel.

“Not they lords these,
Merely effigies carved wood these,”

“Mawi are' ajaw ri',

They said when they arrived.

Xecha' ta xe'oponik.

When then it was demanded of them,
Not then was left out his name by them.

“Sit down here,”
They were told therefore.

“Kixku' uloq,”
Xe'uchax k'ut.

They wanted them on its top bench.
Not therefore they wanted it:

Xerajoq chuwi' tem.
Ma k'u xkaj:

“Not this our bench this,
Merely heated stone the bench,”

“Mawi are' qa tem ri',
Xa chojim ab'aj ri tem,”

They said Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xecha' Junajpu

The manuscript reads xcanai, likely a scribal error for xcanah.

Mawi xech'akatajik.
“Good then that, merely then go in house,” they were told. “Utz b'a la', xa b'a jix pa ja,” xe'uchaxik.
Then therefore they entered in Darkness House.

They ordered therefore its beginning their defeat then now, Kechi' k'u u tikarik ki ch'akatajik ta chik,
In their hearts Xibalbans.
Chi ki k'u'x Xib'alb'a.
First they entered into Darkness House,
Nab'e xe'ok pa Q'equ'ma Ja,
Then therefore [someone] went to give their torch.
It was burning when it arrived,
With each their cigars by his messenger One Death.
“‘This their torch,’ says lord.

K'ate k'ut ta xb'e ya'oq ki chaj.
Katilowik ta xoponik,

“‘Wa'e ki chaje,’ kacha' ajaw.

‘They must come to give them again
The torch at dawn,
With the cigars.
Let them come and gather them,’ says lord,”

‘Chul ki ya' chik

Said messenger when he arrived.
“Good then that,” they said therefore.

Xcha' samajel ta xoponik.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut,

Not therefore they lit the torch.
Merely flame its substitute entered.
This its tail feather macaw,
Like torch they saw it night watchmen.

Ma k'u xkitzij ri chaj.

These next therefore the cigars,
Merely fireflies they put on their tips cigars.

Are' chi k'u ri sik',
Xa q'aq'a chikop xkikojo chuwi' sik'.

One night they would glow brilliantly because of them.
“We defeated them,” said the night watchmen.

Jun aq'ab' chiyok'owik kumal.
“Mi xeqach'ako,” xecha' waranel.

It was not therefore finished the torch,
Merely only its appearance.
These therefore the cigars,
There is not anything they lit on them.
Merely only its appearance,
They went to give to them lords.

Ma k'u ja b'i xk'is ri chaj,

Truly troubled our hearts,
Because not good they do to us.

Then they summoned therefore all lords.

“Let us play ball, you boys,” they were told.
Then they were asked therefore

“Oj o cha'joq, ix k'ajolab',” xe'uchaxik.
Ta xetz'onox k'ut

By One Death,
Seven Death:

Rumal Jun Kame
Wuqub' Kame:

“Where truly did you come from?
“Apa qi xixpe wi?
May you tell it you boys,” said therefore Xibalbans to them.Chib'ij taj ix k'ajolab',” xcha' k'ut Xib'alb'a chike.
“Somewhere then we have come from perhaps,
Not we know,”

“Ala' b'a xojpe wi lo,

Merely they said,
Nothing they told.

Xa xecha',
Mawi xkib'ij.

“Good then that,
Merely we go to play ball,
You boys,” they said Xibalbans to them.
“Good,” they said.

“Utz b'a la',
Xa qab'e kaqacha'j,
Ix k'ajolab',” xecha' Xib'alb'a chike.
“Utz,” xecha'.

“This then we will use this our rubber ball,” they said
Xibalbans.
“No, this then we will use this ours,” they said boys.

“Are' b'a chiqakoj ri wa' qa kik',” xecha'
Xib'alb'a.
“Ma taj, are' ta chikoj wa' qe,” xecha' k'ajolab'.

“There is not, this we will use this ours,” they said again
Xibalbans.
“Good then that,” they said boys.

“Maja b'i, are' chiqakoj wa' qe,” xecha' chik
Xib'alb'a.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ajolab'.

The manuscript reads re, which is likely a scribal error.

---
“Not then it, merely skull we say again,” they said boys.

“Je b'a la' xa juch'il,” xecha' Xib'alb'a.

“Ma b'a la', xa jolom kojcha' chik,” xecha' k'ajolab'.

“It is not,” they said Xibalbans.
“Good then that,” said Hunahpu.

“Maja b'i,” xecha' Xib'alb'a.
“Utz b'a la',” xcha' Junajpu.

Then it was thrown down therefore hither by Xibalbans
Rubber ball directed before his yoke Hunahpu

Ta xtzaq k'u uloq rumal Xib'alb'a
Kik' u taqal chuwach u b'ate Junajpu.

Then also when they saw it Xibalbans,
The White Dagger then came out inside the rubber ball.

K'ate puch ta xkil Xib'alb'a,
Ri Saqi Toq' ta xel chupan ri kik'.

It clashed about.
It went threatening in front of entire ground the ballcourt.

Chitzininik.
Xb'e je' chuwa taq ulew ri cha'.

“What is that?” said the Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

“Naqi pa la'?” xcha' ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

“Merely death
You want for us.

“Xa kamik
Kiwaj chiqech.

Not then we went to your summons?
Not then also went your messengers?

Ma ta xojb'e i taqa'?
Ma ta pu xb'e i samajel?

Truly pity our faces!
Merely we go,”

Qitzij toq'ob' qa wach!
Xa kojb'ek,”

They said boys to them.
This then therefore was desired to them boys,

Xecha' k'ajolab' chike.
Are' ta k'u xajawax chike k'ajolab',

Straightaway then died these there,
By blade they were to be defeated.

Ju su ta xkam ri' chiri',

Not thus.
Merely Xibalbans were defeated now by boys.

Mawi keje'.
Xa Xib'alb'a xech'akataj chik kumal k'ajolab'.

“Not then you go,
You boys.

“Ma b'a kixb'ek,

Merely this we use the yours,”

Kojcha'j na,
Xa are' kaqakojo ri iwech,”

Were told therefore boys.

Xuchax k'ut k'ajolab'.

“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut.

This therefore entered the their rubber ball.
Then was dropped therefore ball.

Are' k'u xok ri ki kik'.
Ta xqaj k'u cha'j.

Then therefore they chose their prize.
“What will we win?” they said Xibalbans.

K'ate k'ut ta xkicho'y ki ch'ako'n.
“Naqi pa chiqach'ako?” xecha' Xib'alb'a.

“As surely you indicate it,” merely they said boys.
“Merely our prize four each bowls flowers,” they said
Xibalbans.

“Je na kik'ut,” xa xecha' k'ajolab'.
“Xa qa ch'aka kajkaj sel kotz'i'j,” xecha' Xib'alb'a.

“Good then that,
What kinds flowers?” they said boys to Xibalbans.
“One bowlful red petals,
One bowlful white petals,
One bowlful of yellow petals,
One bowlful therefore the great ones,”
They said Xibalbans.
“Good then that,” said therefore boys.

“Utz b'a la',
Naqi pa chi kotz'i'jal?” xecha' k'ajolab' chike
Xib'alb'a.
“Ju tik'ab' kaqa much'ij,

Xecha' Xib'alb'a.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut k'ajolab'.

Then was dropped therefore their ball,
Equal their strength.

Ta xqaj k'ut ki cha',
Junam ki chuq'ab'.

Numerous also their ball plays the boys,
Merely therefore much its goodnesses their hearts.

Tzatz pu ki cha' ri k'ajolab',
Xa k'u k'i rutz ki k'u'x.

Then they gave themselves to be defeated the boys.
They rejoice therefore
The Xibalbans,
When they were defeated.

Ta xkiya' kib' chich'akatajik ri k'ajolab'.
Keki'kot k'ut
Ri Xib'alb'a,

“Good we did.
First we defeated them,” they said Xibalbans.

“Utz mi xqab'ano.
Nab'e mi xeqach'ako,” xecha' Xib'alb'a.

“Where shall they go
To get the flowers?”

“Apa xchib'e

They said in their hearts.
“Truly when early morning
You shall give the our flowers,
Our prize as well,”

“Good then that,
Early morning again therefore we play ball,”
They said therefore when they took counsel together.

Xe'uchax puch k'ajolab',
Junajpu,
Xb'alanke,
Rumal Xib'alb'a.
“Utz b'a la',
Aq'ab'a' chi k'ut kojcha'jik,”
Xecha' k'ut ta xepixab'an kib'.

Then again therefore they entered boys in Blade House,
Second trial Xibalba.

K'ate chi k'ut ta xe'ok chi k'ajolab' pa Chaim Ja,
U kab' tijob'al Xib'alb'a.

This then therefore was desired now,
They were to be sliced apart by blades.
Rapid it was to be in their hearts,

Are' ta k'ut xajawax chik,
Xeq'ataq'ox taj rumal cha.
Chanim taj chi ki k'u'x,

They were to die in their hearts,
Not therefore they died.

Xekam taj chi ki k'u'x,
Ma k'u xekamik.

Then they said to blades,
Then they instructed them:

Ta xecha' chire cha,
Ta xkipixab'aj:

“This yours,
The all its flesh animals,” they said to blades.

“Are' iwe,
Ri ronojel u tio'jil chikop,” xecha' chire cha.

Not therefore they moved again,
Merely one lowered again point blades all of them.

Ma k'u xesilab' chik,
Xa jun qaj chi wi' cha ronojel.

These therefore they were then,
There in Blade House at night.

Are' k'ut e k'o chi,
Chiri' pa Chaim Ja chaq'ab'.

Then they called all ants:
“Cutting ants,
Conquering ants,
Come! Go all of you to get

Ta xkisik'ij ronojel sanik:
“Chay sanik,
Ch'eken sanik,
Kixpetoq! Kixojo' iwonojel ojik'ama'

All its blossoms flowers,
Their prizes lords.”

Ronojel u wach kotz'i'j,
Ki ch'ako'n ajawab'.”

“Good then that,”
They said therefore.

“Utz b'a la',”
Xecha' k'ut.

Then they went therefore the ants,
All obtainers flowers their garden

Ta xeb'e k'u ri sanik,
Konojel e k'amol kotz'i'j u tiko'n

---
Seven Death.

Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

Earlier therefore they instructed
Guardians their flowers the Xibalbans:

Mieroq k'ut chikipixab'aj
Chajal ki kotz'i'j ri Xib'alb'a:

“Vigilantly look after our flowers,
Do not allow that they be stolen.

“Laq'i chiwila' qa kotz'i'j,
Miya' chi eleq'axik.

By this we defeated the boys.
What if came these perhaps our prize by them?

Rumal ri' mi xeqach'ako ri k'ajolab'.
Ana wi xpe wi ri' lo qa ch'ako'n kumal?

There is not you will sleep one night.”
“Good then that,” they said therefore.

Maja b'i chiwaraj jun aq'ab'.”
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut.

Not therefore they sensed the guardians garden.
Without purpose they would break open their mouths

Ma k'u xkina' ri chajal tiko'n.
Xaloq' chikiraquj ki chi'

In its branches trees,
Garden as well.

Chuq'ab' taq che',
Tiko'n puch.

They go toddling along there,
Merely only they would repeat the their song:

Keb'e chakala chiri',
Xa wi xere chikich'ab'ej ri ki b'ix:

“Shpurpuwek,
Shpurpuwek,”

“Xpurpuweq,
Xpurpuweq,”

Says the one
When he calls.

Cha' ri jun
Ta choq'ik.

“Puhuyu,
Puhuyu,”

“Pujuyu,
Pujuyu,”

Says other,
When he calls,

Cha' chik
Ta choq'ik,

The whippoorwill,
His name.

Ri pujuyu,
U b'i'.

They two then
Guardians garden,

E kaib' chi
Chajal tiko'n,

---
Seven Death.

U tiko'n Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

Not therefore they sensed
The ants stealers of what they had guarded.

Ma k'u kakina'
Ri sanik eleq'ay ki chajem.

They swarm,
They throng,

Kab'olowik,
Katukuwik,

Carriers away flowers,
That go to cut them hither,

Eray kotz'i'j,
Ri kab'e q'atowa uloq,

Flowers
In its tops trees theirs
Gathered with those below trees
The flowers.

Kotz'i'j
Chuwi' che' re
Kasik'ow kuk' chuxe' che'
Ri kotz'i'j.

Merely thus they would break open their mouths the
guardians.
Not surely theirs they sensed

Xa keje' chikiraquj ki chi' ri chajalib'.

They gnawed their tails,
They gnawed their wings.

Kak'ux ki je',
Kak'ux ki xik'.

These are loosened flowers,
Until they fall hither

Are' kakirixik kotz'i'j,
K'a kaqaj uloq

Theirs they gather,
Theirs they go to cut hither.

Re kasik'owik,
Re kab'e q'atowa uloq.

Ma na re kakina'o

Immediately then therefore were filled four bowls flowers, Lib'aj chi k'ut xnoj kajib' sel kotz'i'j,
Accumulated now therefore when it dawned.
Tik'itoj chi k'ut ta xsaqirik.
Then therefore arrived messengers,
Summoners,

K'ate k'ut ta xul samajel,
Taqonel,

“‘Come!’ says lord,
‘Straightaway may they bring hither the our prize,’”

“‘Kepetoq!’ kacha' ajaw,
‘Ju suk' chikik'am ula ri qa ch'ako'n,’”

They were told therefore boys.
“Good then that,” they said therefore.

Xe'uchax k'ut k'ajolab'.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut.

They had accumulated therefore

Ki tik'ela'on k'u

---

Ri kotz'i'j kajib' sel.

Then they went,
Then they arrived therefore

Ta xeb'ek,
Ta xe'opon k'u

Before their faces lords.
Lords having received flowers woeful their faces.

Chikiwach ajaw.
Ajawab' kuk'am kotz'i'j q'us u wach.

Thus they were defeated Xibalbans.
Merely ants they sent the boys.

Keje' k'ut xech'akataj wi Xib'alb'a.
Xa sanik xkitaq ri k'ajolab'.

Merely all night they took them ants,
Then they put them in bowls.

Xa jun aq'ab'il xkichap sanik,
Ta kiya' pa sel.

Thus they turned pale the all Xibalbans,
Pallid their faces because of the flowers.

Keje' k'ut xesaqkaje' ri konojel Xib'alb'a,
Saqb'uk ki wach rumal ri kotz'i'j.

Then therefore they summoned the guardians flowers:
“What its reason you gave our flowers to be stolen?
These our flowers these you see,”
They were told guardians.

K'ate k'ut xkitaq ri chajal kotz'i'j:

“Naqi pa rumal mi xiya' qa kotz'i'j chi eleq'axik?
Are' qa kotz'i'j wa'e kawilo,”
Xe'uchax chajal.

“Not then we sensed it you lords,
But surely theirs they suffered our tails,”

“Ma b'a xqana'o at ajaw,
Mi na re xkuyu qa je',”

They said therefore.
Then also were split open their mouths,

Xecha' k'ut.
K'ate puch xjix ki chi',

Their punishment
They guarded now was stolen.

Ki tojb'al
Ki chajin chi eleq'axik.

Thus their defeat One Death,
Seven Death,

Keje' k'ut ki ch'akatajik Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame,

By Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Kumal Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Its root the deed this,
Then they received the their mouths gaping.

U xe' ri b'anoj ri',
Ta xkik'am ri ki chi' jereb'aq.

Their mouths whippoorwills
Gaping to this day.

Ki chi' purpuweq
Jereb'aq wakamik.

---
Merely only equal they played ball.

K'ate chi k'ut ta xqaj cha'j,
Xa wi xere junam kecha'jik.

They finished again therefore playing ball,
Then they took counsel again therefore together.

Xkelej chi k'u cha'j,
Ta xepixab'an chi k'u kib'.

“Dawn again,” they said Xibalbans.
“Good then that,” said boys when they finished.

“Saqirik chik,” xecha' Xib'alb'a.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ajolab' ta xkelej.

THEY entered now therefore in Cold House
Not measured cold.
Thick with hail within house,
Its home cold.

XE'OK chi k'ut pa Tew Ja.
Mawi ajilan tew.
Tzatz chi saqb'oqom chupan ja,
Rochoch tew.

Straightaway therefore was dissipated cold.
By them it was finished,
Ruined,
Destroyed the cold by boys.

Ju su k'u stzaj tew.
Rumal kutzina[q],
Ma'ina[q],
Xsach ri tew kumal k'ajolab'.

Not they died,
Instead they are alive
When it dawned.
This then therefore wanted Xibalbans,
There then they died.
Not like that.
Instead therefore good their faces
When it dawned.

Mawi xekamik,
Xa wi e k'aslik
Ta xsaqirik.
Are' ta k'u xkaj Xib'alb'a,
Chiri' ta xekam wi.
Mawi keje'.
Xa wi k'u utz ki wach
Ta xsaqirik.

They left again hither summoners theirs,
They went again guardians.

Xekel chi ula taqol ke,
Xeb'e chik e chajal.

“What is it,
Not they died?” said now its lords Xibalba.

“Naqi pa la',
Mawi mi xekamik?” xcha' chi rajawal Xib'alb'a.

They marveled at again
Their deeds boys,

Xkimayijaj chik
Ki b'anoj k'ajolab',

The manuscript reads ztzah. The completive aspect should be xtzah, however, Mondloch (personal communication) points out that
the completive aspect prefix x- is pronounced s- when it occurs before tz, tz' or s. Thus xsaqirik is pronounced saqirik.

The manuscript reads cutz ma, although the “m” is uncharacteristically sloppy and could be an “n.” I agree with Edmonson that this
is likely a scribal error for cutzina[c].

---
Xbalanque.

Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

THEN they entered again therefore in Jaguar House.
Crowded with jaguars Jaguar’s Home.

K'ATE xe'ok chi k'ut pa B'alami Ja.
Tzatz chi b'alam B'alam Rochoch.

“Not you eat us.
There is yours will become,” they were told jaguars.

“Mawi kojiti'o.
K'o iwech chuxik,” xe'uchaxik b'alam.

Then therefore they scattered bones before beasts,
Then therefore they crunch there over bones.

K'ate k'ut xkipuk'ij b'aq chikiwach chikop,
K'ate k'ut kepaq'aq'ik chiri' chuwi' b'aq.

“They were therefore finished,
They ate their hearts.

“Mi k'u xe'utzinik,
Mi xutij ki k'u'x.

Then they gave themselves.
These their skeletons that are being gnawed on,”

K'ate wi ri mi xkiya' kib'.
Are' ki b'aqil ri kak'uxixik,”

Said the night watchmen.
All of them sweet their hearts to it.

Xecha' ri waranel.
Konojel ki' ki k'u'x chire.

Not therefore they died,
Merely only good their faces.

Ma k'u xekamik,
Xa wi xere utz ki wach.

They came out hither
From Jaguar House.

Xe'el uloq
Pa B'alami Ja.

“What therefore now kind of people?
Where therefore did they come from?”

“Naqi pa k'u chi e winaqil?
Apa k'u xepe wi?”

They said the Xibalbans,
All of them.

Xecha' ri Xib'alb'a,
Konojel.

THEN again they entered into fire,
Another house of fire.

K'ATE chik xe'ok chupam q'aq',
Jun ja chi q'aq'.

Merely alone fire its interior,
Not they were burned by it.

Xa u tukel q'aq' u pam,
Mawi xek'atik rumal.

The manuscript reads qui which is likely a scribal error for cu.

---
Merely they were to be set on fire.

Xa b'olol,
Xa tzimaj wi.

Instead only good now
Their faces

Xa wi xere utz chi

When it dawned.
This then are desired

Ta xsaqirik.
Are' ta kajawaxik

Straightaway then they die inside
This they pass through.

Ju suk' ta kekamik chupan
Ri' ke'ik'ow wi.

Not so.
Merely lost their hearts Xibalbans because of it.

Mawi keje'.
Xa wi kasach ki k'u'x Xib'alb'a rumal.

THEY were put again inside Bat House,
Alone bats inside next house.

XEKOJ chik chupan Sotz'in Ja,
U tukel sotz' chupam chi ja.

One house of death bats,
Great animals.

Jun ja chi kama sotz',
Nima'q chikop.

Like the blades their snouts,
Their means of murder.

Keje' ri cha ki tza'm,
Ki kamisab'al.

Straightaway they were to be finished
They were to arrive before their faces.

Ju su chutzinik
Chopon chikiwach.

They were therefore there inside
Merely in blowguns they slept.

Xek'oje' k'u chiri' chupan
Xa pa wub' xewar wi.

Not were they eaten
By these that are in house.

Mawi xeti'ik
Rumal ri' e k'o pa ja.

There therefore they gave themselves one
Because of one death bat.

Chiri' k'ut xkiya' wi kib' jun wi
Rumal jun chi kama sotz'.

It would descend,
It came.

Chiqaj,
Xpe wi.

Merely their self-manifestation
When they did it.

Xa wi u k'utb'al rib'
Ta xkib'ano.

---
Their wisdom.

Rumal ko kakitz'onoj wi
Ki na'oj.

One night therefore
The bats make flapping sounds with their wings:

Jun aq'ab' k'u
Ri sotz' keb'ujujik:

“Keeleetz!
Keeleetz!”

“Kilitz!
Kilitz !”

They say,
They say all night.

Kecha',
Kecha' jun aq'ab'.

Ceased therefore these a little.
There is not now they move the bats.

Xtane' k'u ri' sqaqi'n.
Maja b'i chik kesilob'ik ri sotz'.

There therefore crawling the one
End blowgun.

Chiri' k'u chakal wi ri jun
Tza'm wub'.

Said therefore the Xbalanque:
“Hunahpu,

Xcha' k'u ri Xb'alanke:
“Junajpu,

Yet when its dawn you see?”
“Yet when it then perhaps I shall see it surely,” he said
therefore.

K'a janik' pa u saqirik kawilo?”
“K'a janik'an la' b'a lo wila' na,” xcha' k'ut.

Truly therefore he wanted to look hither from its mouth
blowgun,
He wanted to see sees hither its dawn.

Qi k'u are' karaj muqum uloq chuchi' wub',

Then also was cut off his head by death bat,
Cut off now behind the greater part the Hunahpu.

K'ate puch ta xqupix u jolom rumal kama sotz',
Qupul chi kanoq u nimal ri Junajpu.

“How is it, not it dawned?” said the Xbalanque.
There is not now he would move the Hunahpu.

“Jucha'lik, ma mi xsaqirik?” xcha' ri
Xb'alanke.
Maja b'i chik chisilob'ik ri Junajpu.

“What then, not perhaps went Hunahpu?
What then you did?”

“Jupacha', ma xa on mi xb'ek Junajpu?
Jupacha' mi xab'ano?”

There was not he would move,
Merely would rustle wings now.

Maja b'i chisilab'ik,
Xaqi chiqosos chik.

Then therefore was ashamed Xbalanque.

K'ate k'ut xuk'ixb'ij Xb'alanke.

Karaj ril uloq u saqirik.

---

“Akarok, mi xqaya' yan,” xcha' k'ut.

There therefore went to place first his head,
On its top ballcourt.

Chila' k'ut xb'e k'ola na wi u jolom,
Chuwi' jom.

Merely their word One Death,
Seven Death.

Xa wi u tzij Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

They rejoice therefore the Xibalbans all of them
Because of his head Hunahpu.

Keki'kot k'u ri Xib'alb'a konojel
Rumal u jolom Junajpu.

Then therefore he summoned animals,
All of them:

K'ate k'ut ta xutaq chikop,
Ronojel:

Coati,
Peccary,

Sis,
Aq,

All small animals,
Great animals,

Ronojel ch'uti chikop,
Nima chikop,

At night,
Merely instead its early morning.

Chaq'ab',
Xa wi xare raq'ab'al.

Then he asked for therefore
Their food.

Ta xutz'onoj k'ut
Kecha'.

“Whatsoever your food each of you
This I summon you to bring hither the your food,”

“Naqi taq pa iwecha' chi jujunal
Are' kixnutaq wi chik'am uloq ri iwecha',”

He said therefore Xbalanque to them.
“Good then that,” they said therefore.

Xcha' k'ut Xb'alanke chike.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut.

Then they went obtainers theirs,
Then they arrived many therefore all of them.

Ta xeb'ek e k'amol rech,
Ta xe'ul je k'ut konojel.

There were mere rotten things they went to get,
There were mere leaves they went to get,
There were mere stones they went to get,
There was mere dirt they went to get.

K'o xa q'umar rech xb'e u k'ama',
K'o xa tz'alik xb'e u k'ama',
K'o xa ab'aj xb'e u k'ama',
K'o xa ulew xb'e u k'ama'.

Various their foods the [small] animals,

Jalajoj kecha' ri [ch'uti] chikop,

It is likely that ch'uti (small) should have been part of this couplet, paired with nima (great) as it is throughout the text.

---

Nima chikop.

Many as well until last remaining the coati,
Chilacayote squash she went to get.

K'i pu k'a u xamb'e kanajoq ri sis,
Q'oq' xb'e u k'ama'.

She rolls it with her nose as she comes.
This therefore entered transformation his head Hunahpu.

Kub'alka'tij chutza'm kapetik.
Are' k'ut xok jalwachib'al u jolom Junajpu.

Immediately now were carved its seeds its face.
Crowded with sages from sky came.

Lib'aj chi xk'otox u b'aq' u wach.
Tzatz chi aj na'oj chi kaj xpe wi.

This its Heart Sky,
Huracan.

Are' u K'u'x Kaj,
Juraqan.

He appeared hither,
He arrived therefore hither

Xulk'o loq,
Xulu k'u loq

There
In Bat House.

Chiri'
Pa Sotz'i Ja.

Not therefore soon it was successfully completed his face, Ma k'u ata'n xutzinik u wach,
Good now it became.
Utz chik xuxik.
Merely only its covering beautiful it appeared,
Merely only it spoke.

Xa wi xare u ch'uq jeb'el xwachinik,
Xa wi xare xch'awik.

While therefore then it would want to dawn,
It would redden its root sky.

Are k'ut ta chiraj saqirik,
Chikaqtarin u xe' kaj.

“Blacken it with soot surely again,
Old man,” was told the possum.
“Fine,” said the grandfather.
Then again he blackened it with soot.

“Kaxaqi' na chik,
Ama',” xuchax ri wuch'.
“We',” xcha' ri mama'.
Ta chi xaqinik.

Then it was darkened again.
Four times he blackened it with soot the grandfather.

K'ate ta chiq'equ'mar chik.
Kaj mul xaqin ri mama'.

“He blackens it with soot possum,”
Say people today.

“Kaxaqin wuch',”
Kacha' winaq wakamik.

Merely therefore red blue it succeeded
When it began its existence.

Xa k'u kaq rax utzinik
Ta xutikib'a' u k'ojik.

---
“Yes good,” he said therefore.

“Ma utz?” chuchax k'ut Junajpu.
“Je' utz,” xcha' k'ut.

Merely only would be supported his head,
Like truly his head it came to be.

Xa wi xare chub'aqitila' u jolom,
Keje' ri' qitzij u jolom xuxik.

Then therefore they made their words,
They counseled together.

K'ate k'ut ta xkib'an ki tzij,
Xepixab'an kib'.

“Not any you play ball,
Merely you look threatening.

“Ma naqi katcha'jik,
Xaqi chayekuj awib'.

Merely I one,
Truly I accomplish it,” said Xbalanque to him.

Xa in jun,
Qi kinb'anowik,” xcha' Xb'alanke chire.

Then therefore he instructed a rabbit:
“You be then there
At its head ballcourt.
At head,
You be in tomato patch,”
Was told rabbit by Xbalanque.

K'ate k'ut ta xupixab'aj jun umul:
“Katk'oje' ta chiri'
Chuwi' jom.
Chi wi',
Katk'oje' wi chupan pixk,”
Xuchax umul rumal Xb'alanke.

“When it will come rubber ball with you,
Then you go out

“Chopon na kik' awuk',
K'ate katelik

Until I accomplish it,”
Was told the rabbit,

K'a in kib'anowik,”
Xuchax ri umul,

When he was instructed
In the night.

Ta xpixab'axik
Chaq'ab'.

Then therefore it dawned,
Merely instead good their faces both of them.

K'ate k'ut ta xsaqirik,
Xa wi xare utz ki wach ki kab' ichal.

DROPPED again therefore their ball,
Placed now therefore his head Hunahpu atop ballcourt

XQAJ chi k'u ki cha'j,
K'olan chi k'u u jolom Junajpu chuwi' jom.

“We triumphed already,
You did it,

“Mi xqach'ako yan,
Mi xib'ano,

You give in,
You gave it,”

Kiya'n,
Mi xiya'o,”

---
Merely therefore only he would call out Hunahpu:
“Strike the head as rubber ball,”
They are told.

Xe'uchaxik.
Xa wi k'u xere chisik'in Junajpu:
“Chak'aqa' ri jolom chi kik',”
Ke'uchaxik.

“Not therefore they will harm us again,
We will be threatening.”

“Ma k'u chikiqaq'axow chik,
Chiyekow qib'.”

They therefore threw down rubber ball its lords Xibalba.
He met it therefore Xbalanque.

Are' k'u xetzaqow kik' rajawal Xib'alb'a.
Xuk'ul k'ut Xb'alanke.

It landed therefore the rubber ball before yoke,
It bounced.

Taqal k'u ri kik' chuwach b'ate,
Chitanenik.

Then it went out,
Straightaway therefore it passed over rubber ball above
ballcourt.

Ta xelik,
Ju su k'u xik'ow kik' chuwi' jom.

Merely one,
Merely two bounces landed in tomatoes.

Xa jun,
Xa ka nab' wi taqal pa pix.

Then he went out therefore the rabbit
Hopping along,

Ta xel k'u ri umul
Chik'oxk'otik,

Then they went fleeing therefore,
Then they went all the Xibalbans.
They shout,
They rush about.
They went after the rabbit,
They ended up going all Xibalba.

Ta xb'ek oq'otal k'ut,
Ta xb'e kumal ri Xib'alb'a.
Kejuminik,
Kechaninik.
Xeb'e chirij ri umul,
Xek'is b'e konojel Xib'alb'a.

Then therefore they retrieved the his head Hunahpu,
It was planted again his chilacayote squash Xbalanque.

K'ate k'ut xkik'amixtaj ri u jolom Junajpu,
Xtikixtaj chik u q'oq' Xb'alanke.

These now therefore went
To place the chilacayote squash on its top ballcourt.

Are' chi k'ut xb'e
Kikub'a' ri q'oq' chuwi' jom.

True head again therefore
His head the Hunahpu.

Qitzij jolom chi k'u
U jolom ri Junajpu.

They rejoice now therefore,
Both of them.

Keki'kot chi k'u,
Ki kab' ichal.

---
The Xibalbans.

Are' k'ut keb'e tzuku na kik'
Ri Xib'alb'a.

Then therefore they retrieved it again,
The rubber ball in tomatoes.

K'ate k'ut xkik'amixtaj chi,
Ri kik' pa pix.

Then they called again therefore:
“Come!

Ta xesik'in chi k'ut:
“Kixpetoq!

This rubber ball ours,
We found it!” they said.

Wa'e kik' qe,
Mi xqariqo!” xecha'.

They were carrying a round thing now therefore
When they came Xibalbans.

Ki k'olem chi k'ut
Ta xe'ul Xib'alb'a.

“What this we saw?”
They said therefore.

“Naqi pa ri' mi xqilo?”
Xecha' k'ut.

Then they began again therefore to play ball,
Ta xkitikib'a' chi k'ut cha'jik,
Equal ball plays now therefore they did now both of them. Junam cha'jik chi k'ut xkib'an chik ki kab' ichal.
Then therefore was struck the chilacayote squash by
Xbalanque.
It strewed the chilacayote squash dropped in ballcourt.

K'ate k'ut xk'aqataj ri q'oq' rumal Xb'alanke.

Scattered therefore
The its seeds before their faces.

Saqiram k'u
Ri u sakilal chikiwach.

“What this you went to get?
Where is the obtainer of it?” said Xibalbans.

“Naqi pa ri' chib'e i k'ama'?
Apa k'o wi ri k'amol re?” xcha' Xib'alb'a.

Thus their defeat
Its lords Xibalba,

Keje' k'ut ki ch'akatajik
Rajawal Xib'alb'a,

By Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Rumal Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Great affliction they were in,
Not these they died.

Nima k'axk'ol xek'oje' wi,
Mawi are' xekam wi.

The everything
Was done to them.

Ri ronojel

This their memorial their deaths we shall tell now.

ARE' k'ut wa'e ki nab'al ki kamik

Are' wa' ki nab'al ki kamik xchiqab'ij chik.

When they planned therefore,
They did it.

Ta xepixab'aj k'ut,
Xkib'ano.

All affliction,
Misfortune done to them,

Ronojel k'axk'ol,
Ra'il xb'an chike,

Not they died by
Its trials Xibalba.
Not were they defeated by
All ravenous animals there are in Xibalba.

Mawi xekamik rumal

Then therefore they summoned two seers,
As these visionaries.

K'ate k'ut ta xkitaq chi kaib' nik'wachinel,
Keje' ri' e ilol.

They their names these:
Descended,
Ascended.
They sages.

Are' ki b'i' wa':
Xulu,
Paqam.
E eta'manel.

“If we are asked about to you by its lords Xibalba,

“We kojtz'onoxik chiwe kumal rajawal
Xib'alb'a,
Rumal ri' qa kamik.
Ki na'oj kakinuk'
Rumal ri' mawi mi xojkamik,
Ma pu mi xojch'akatajik.

Ma xa chikop chok chiqe.
Are' k'u retal wa' chi qa k'u'x:

Mi xekuchu kib' ronojel Xib'alb'a,
Ma k'u qitzij ta kojkamik.
Are' k'u i na'oj
Wa' xchiqab'ij.

Because of this our death.
Their thoughts they combine
Because of this not we died,
Not also we were defeated.
We confounded their trials,
Not merely animals entered to us.
This therefore its sign this in our hearts:
Heated stones means of murder ours by them.
They gathered themselves all Xibalba,
Not therefore truly then we die.
This therefore your thought
This we shall tell.

The manuscript appears to read o here, although it is unclear. James Mondloch suggests that it should likely be e (personal
communication).

---
About our death when we are burned,

We kixul tz'onob'exoq kumal
Chirech qa kamik ta kojk'atoq,

What shall you tell them,
You Descended,
You Ascended,
If they speak to you?

Naqi xchikucha'j,
Ix Xulu,
Ix Paqam,
We kecha' chiwe?

‘Not good perhaps
We will scatter then
Their bones in canyon,’
‘If not then good?

‘Ma utz lo
Chiqatix ta
Ki b'aqil pa siwan,’
‘We ma b'a utz?

Merely only again would be revived their faces,’ you say. Xa wi xere chik chik'astaj ki wach,’ kixcha'.
‘If then this good
‘We b'a are' utz
Merely we shall hang them
Xa chiqaxekeb'a'
In its top tree?’ then they say again to you.
Chuwi' che'?’ ta kecha' chik chiwe.
‘Certainly not good,
‘Xax ma utz wi,
Merely only you would see before their faces,’ you say.
Xa wi xere chiwil chikiwach,’ kixcha'.
Then they say again therefore
For third time,

Ta kecha' chi k'ut
Chi rox mul,

‘Merely then this its good thing
Merely we will scatter their bones in its course river?’

‘Xa b'a are' rutzil
Xa chiqatix ki b'aqil pa raqan ja'?’

If therefore you are told then by them,
‘This good then that they die,

We k'ut kixuchax chik kumal,
‘Are' utz b'a la' kekamik,

Then therefore good
That they would be ground their bones on its face stone,

K'ate k'u utz
Chijok' ki b'aqil chuwach ab'aj,

Like would be ground fine maize flour,
Each one therefore would be ground.

Keje' ri' chike'x k'ajim jal,
Jujunal k'u chike'ik.

Then therefore would be scattered thither in its course river,K'ate k'u chitix ub'ik chi raqan a',
Would be sprinkled on therefore river,
Chirikaj k'u a',
That goes through small mountains,

The manuscript reads tzonobex xoc, which is likely a scribal error.

The manuscript reads re, likely a scribal error for are.

Chib'e ch'uti juyub',

---

Nima juyub',’

You say therefore.
Then will be made manifest
The our counsel,
We said to you,”

Kixcha' k'ut.
Ta chik'utunisaj
Ri qa pixab',
Mi xqab'ij chiwe,”

Said Xhunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Xecha' Xjunajpu,
Xb'alanke.

When they gave counsel,
They knew of their death.

Ta xepixab'ik,
Xketa'maj ki kamik.

This is made the great heated stones,
Like the pit oven.
Truly they made it Xibalbans,
Great coals they placed.

Are' kab'an ri nima chojim ab'aj,
Keje' ri chojib'al.
Qi xkib'an Xib'alb'a,
Nima'q xaq xkikojo.

Then therefore arrived messengers,
Accompaniers theirs,

K'ate k'ut xul samajel,
Achb'ilay ke,

Their messengers One Death,
Seven Death.

U samajel Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

“‘May they come!
We go then with boys,
To go then
To see

“‘Kepetoq!
Kojb'e ta kuk' k'ajolab',
Chib'e ta

Until we cook you up,’
Say lords,

K'a kixqachojij,’
Kacha' ajaw,

You boys,”
They were told.

Ix k'ajolab',”
Xe'uchaxik.

“Good then that,”
They said therefore.

“Utz b'a la',”
Xecha' k'ut.

Quickly they went,
They arrived therefore at its mouth pit oven.

Anim xeb'ek,
Xe'opon k'ut chuchi' choj.

There therefore they wanted to force
Into playing.

Chiri' k'ut xeraj ch'ij wi
Chi etz'anem.

---
Four times,

“Qach'opij wa'e ri qa ki',
Kaj taq mul taj,

Across it
Each one of us,

Chi q'axiq'aj
Chiqajujunal,

You boys,” they were told therefore
By One Death.

Ix k'ajolab',” xecha'x k'ut
Rumal Jun Kame.

“Not this you pluck us this.
Not do we know our death,

“Mawi are' kojimich' wi ri'.
Ma pa qeta'm qa kamik,

You lords?
You will see it surely,” they said therefore.

Ix ajawab'?
Chiwila' na,” xecha' k'ut.

Then they faced each others face,
They spread their hands both of them,

Ta xkik'ulawachij ki wach,
Xkirip ki q'ab' ki kab' ichal,

They also headfirst when they went in pit oven,
There therefore they died both of them.

E pu jupujuj ta xeb'ek pa choj,
Chiri' k'ut xekam wi ki kab' ichal.

They rejoice now therefore
All Xibalbans.

Keki'kot chi k'ut
Ronojel Xib'alb'a.

Contented their shouting,
Contented their whistling.

Taqal ki yuyub',
Taqal ki xulq'ab'.

“We defeated them!
Truly not too soon they gave themselves,” they said.

“Mi xeqach'ako!
Qitzij mawi ata'n xkiya' kib',” xecha'.

Then therefore their summoning the Descended,
Ascended,

K'ate k'ut ki taqik ri Xulu,
Paqam,

They left behind their word.
Merely only were asked

Xkanaj wi ki tzij.
Xa wi xare xtz'onox

These went their bones,
When they divined Xibalbans.

Ri xb'e wi ki b'aqil,
Ta xeq'ijin Xib'alb'a.

Were ground their bones,
Were strewn along its course river,

Xjok' ki b'aqil,
Xb'e tixoq chi raqan a',

---
Merely straightaway they sank beneath water.

Ma k'u xeb'e ta chi naj.
Xa ju su xeqaj chuxe' a'.

Chosen boys they came to be,
Merely only their faces came to be.

E cha'om k'ajolab' xe'uxik,
Xa wi xere ki wach xuxik.

They appeared again therefore,
ON fifth day therefore they appeared again.

Xek'utun chi k'ut,
CHI ro' b'ix k'ut xek'utun chik.

They were seen in river by people,
They two like the mere people fish they appeared.

Xe'il chi ya' rumal winaq,
E kaib' keje' ri xa winaq kar xewachinik.

When were seen their faces by Xibalbans,
They were searched for therefore in rivers.

Ta xil ki wach kumal Xib'alb'a,
Xetzukux k'ut chi taq ya'.

Very next day therefore they would appear,
They two as poor orphans,

Xchuweqa k'ut kek'utunoq,
E kaib' chi meb'a'.

Rags their fronts,
Rags also on their backs,
Rags therefore their coverings.

Atz'iyaq ki wach,
Atz'iyaq pu kij,
Atz'iyaq k'ut ki q'u'.

Not surely they would do henceforth then their appearance, Ma na chib'an an ta ki wach,
When truly they were seen by Xibalbans.
Ta qi xe'ilik rumal Xib'alb'a.
Various now therefore they did it
Merely Dance Whippoorwill,
Dance Weasel,
Merely Armadillo they danced,
Merely Centipede,
Merely Injury they danced now.
Many marvels they did now.

Jala chi k'ut xkib'ano
Xa Xajoj Pujuy,
Xajoj Kux,
Xa Ib'oy xkixajo,
Xa Xtz'ul,
Xa Ch'itik xkixaj chik.
K'iya mayijab'al xkib'an chik.

They burned house like it truly would burn,
Immediately now therefore they would create again.

Xkiporoj ja keje' ri' qitzij chik'atik,
Lib'aj chi k'ut chiwinaqir chik.

Crowded now Xibalbans to watch.
Then they would sacrifice themselves.

Tzatz chi Xib'alb'a chika'yik.
K'ate chikipus kib'.

He would die one of them,
He would throw himself down surely in death.

Chikam jun chike,
Chipune' na chi kaminaqil.

First they would kill themselves,

Nab'e chikikamisaj kib',

---
Merely they watch with admiration Xibalbans,
When they would do it.

Xa kika'y Xib'alb'a,
Ta chikib'ano.

All they did now,
Its groundwork now,

Ronojel xkib'an chik,
U xe'najik chik,

Defeat theirs
Xibalbans by them.

Ch'akb'al kech
Xib'alb'a kumal.

THEN now also its arrival now
Its news their dances

K'ATE chi puch roponik chik
U tzijel ki xajoj

In ears lords One Death,
Seven Death.

Chi xikin ajawab' Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

They said when they heard it,
“Who the two poor orphans?

Xcha' ta xkita'o,
“Naqi ri e kaib' meb'a'?

Is it true that delightful?
True also that beautiful

La qitzij wi chi kus?
Qitzij wi pu chi jeb'elik

Their dancing,
All they do?” they asked therefore.

Ki xajowik,
Ronojel kakib'ano?” xcha' k'ut.

Their account arrived with lords,
Delighted they heard it.

Ki tzijoxik xoponik kuk' ajawab',
Kus xkita'o.

Then they entreated therefore their messengers,
Summoners that they come:

Ta xb'ochi' k'ut ki samajel,
Taqol chi kepetoq:

“‘May they arrive to do it,
That we watch.

“‘Chul ta ki b'ana',
Qaka'y.

We would marvel at it,
We would watch it also,

Keqamayijaj taj,
Keqaka'yij ta puch,

They say lords,’
They say it to them,”

Kecha' ajawab',’
Kixcha' chike,”

Were told the messengers.

Xuchax ri samajel.

---

Xe'opon k'ut kuk' ri xajol.

Then they spoke therefore
Their word lords to them.

Ta xch'aw k'ut
Ki tzij ajawab' chike.

“Not then we would want to
Because the truth we are timid.

“Ma b'a chiqaj
Rumal ri qitzij kojxob'ik.

Not merely not we are ashamed
We enter out into lordly house.

Ma xa mawi kojk'ixb'ik
Kojok apanoq chi ajawal ja.

Because truly ugly our faces,
Not merely their largeness our eyes in poverty.

Rumal qi itzel qa wach,
Ma xa ki nima'q u b'aq' qa wach chi meb'a'.

Not perhaps is seen to them merely we dancers?
What then would we say to our fellow poor orphans?

Ma xa on ril chire xa oj xajol?
Naqi ta chiqab'ij chike qach meb'a'?

There is responsibility, they desire also the our dancing,
They revive their faces with us.

K'o k'am, kurayij nay pu ri qa xajoj,
Kakik'astaj ki wach quk'.

Not like it therefore we shall do to them the lords,
Thus not we want to,

Ma keje' la' k'u xchiqab'an chike ri ajawab',
Keje' k'u mawi kaqaj wi,

You messengers,”
They said therefore,

Ix samajel,”
Xecha' k'ut,

The Hunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Ri Junajpu,
Xb'alanke.

They were pestered surely their faces upon misfortune,
Upon pain.

Xelejeb'ex na ki wach chuwi' ra',
Chuwi' k'ax.

Red misfortune they went,
Not too soon they wanted to have gone.

Kaq ra'il xeb'ek,
Mawi ata'n xkaj b'enam.

Many times they were compelled,
Merely they would make little progress,

K'iya mul xech'ijik,
Xa chimachka'y,

Messengers before them,
Obtainers theirs.

Samajel chikiwach,
K'amol ke.

Then they went therefore with lord.
THEY arrived also with lords.

Ta xeb'e k'ut ruk' ajaw.
XE'OPON puch kuk' ajawab'.

---
They would prostrate themselves they arrived,
They humbled themselves,
They would stoop over,
They would bow,
They would conceal themselves with rags,

Kemoch'och'ik,
Chikixulela ki wach xe'oponik,
Xkikemelaj kib',
Chikiluk kib',
Chikipach kib',
Chimayo kib' chi atz'iyaq,

True that poor orphans their appearance they arrived.
Then they were asked therefore

Qitzij wi chi meb'a' ki wachib'al xe'oponik.
Ta xtz'onox k'ut

Their mountains,
Their nation as well.

Ki juyub'al,
Kamaq' puch.

They were asked also their mother,
Their father.

Xtz'onox nay puch ki chuch,
Ki qajaw.

“Where do you come from?”
They were asked.

“Apa kixpe wi?”
Xe'uchaxik.

“Not then we know you lord.
Not we learned their faces

“Ma b'a qeta'on at ajaw.
Mawi xqeta'maj u wach

Our mother,
Our father.

Qa chuch,
Qa qajaw.

Still we were small
When they died,”

K'a oj ch'uti'koq
Ta xekamik,”

Merely they said.
Not anything they told.

Xa xecha'.
Mawi naqi la' xkib'ij.

“Good then that,
May it be done then our spectacle.

“Utz b'a la',
Chib'an ta b'a qa ka'y.

What do you want,
Your payment we will give?” they were asked.

Naqi chiwaj,
Iwajil chiqaya'o?” xe'uchaxik.

“Not then we want.
True that we are afraid,” they said again to lord.

“Ma b'a kaqaj.
Qitzij chi kaqaxib'ij qib',” xecha' chik chire ajaw.

The manuscript reads quih, which is likely a scribal error.

---
Do not be timid.

“Mixib'ij iwib',
Mixxob'ik.

Dance!
This then first you will dance

Kixxajowoq!
Are' ta nab'e chixaj

This you sacrifice then yourselves,
You will burn then therefore the my home.

Ri kixpusu' ta iwib',
Chiporoj ta k'u ri wochoch.

Do everything
That you know.

Chib'ana' ronojel
Ri iweta'm.

We would watch it
We want it.

Kojka'y taj
Kaqaj.

This because of our hearts
You go summoned.

Are' uma qa k'u'x
Kixb'e taqoq.

Because you poor orphans,
We will give your price,” they were told therefore.

Rumal ix meb'a',
Chiqaya' iwajil,” xe'uchax k'ut.

Then they began therefore their songs,
Their dances.

Ta xkitikib'a' k'ut ki b'ix,
Ki xajoj.

Then came therefore all the Xibalbans,
They overflowed spectators.

Ta xul k'ut ronojel ri Xib'alb'a,
Xepulik e ka'yel.

Everything therefore
They danced:

Ronojel k'ut
Xkixajo:

They danced Weasel,
They danced Whippoorwill,
They danced Armadillo.

Xkixaj Kux,
Xkixaj Pujuy,
Xkixaj Ib'oy.

Said therefore lord to them:
“Sacrifice the my dog,
Revive again his face by you,”
They were told.

Xcha' k'u ajaw chike:
“Chipusu' ri nu tz'i',
Chik'astaj chi u wach iwumal,”
Xe'uchaxik.

“Fine,”
They said.

“We',”
Xecha'.

Then they sacrificed dog,

Ta xkipus tz'i',

---
Truly therefore would rejoice the dog
When was revived his face.
He would vigorously wag his tail
When was revived his face.

Xk'astaj chi u wach.
Qitzij k'u chiki'kot ri tz'i'
Ta xk'astaj u wach.
Chusaqb'isala' u je'
Ta xk'astaj u wach.

Said therefore lord to them:
“Burn surely then my home,”
They were told next.
Then they burned therefore his home lord.
Overflowing lords in house all of them,
Not they were burned.

Xcha' k'u ajaw chike:
“Chiporoj na b'a wochoch,”
Xe'uchax chik.
Ta xkiporoj k'ut rochoch ajaw.
E pulinaq ajawab' pa ja konojel,
Mawi xek'atik.

Immediately now again it was restored,
Not surely straightaway lost the his home One Death.

Lib'aj chi chik xkutzinisaj,
Ma na ju su sachik ri rochoch Jun Kame.

They marveled therefore
All lords.

Xkimayijaj k'ut
Konojel ajawab'.

Merely therefore only they dance,
Greatly they rejoice.

Xa wi k'u xere kexajowik,
Nim keki'kotik.

They were told next therefore
By lord,

Xe'uchax chi k'ut
Rumal ajaw,

“Kill surely therefore a person,
Sacrifice him not then therefore he will die,”

“Chikamisaj na k'u jun winaq,
Chipusu' ma ta k'u chikamik,”

They were told therefore.
“Good then that,” they said.

Xe'uchax k'ut.
“Utz b'a la',” xecha'.

Then they seized therefore a person,
Then they sacrificed him.

Ta xkichap k'ut jun winaq,
K'ate xkipusu.

They extracted therefore up his heart the one person,
They placed it therefore before their faces lords.

Xkipoq'oj k'u aq'anoq u k'u'x ri jun winaq,
Xkik'olob'a' k'ut chikiwach ajawab'.

They marveled at it now therefore One Death,
Seven Death.

Xkimayijaj chi k'ut Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

The manuscript reads xqaztai, likely a scribal error for xqaztah (Mondloch, personal communication).
The manuscript reads xquimaiha, likely a scribal error for xquimaihah. See line  where it is written properly.

---
The one person by them.
Greatly would rejoice his heart
When was revived his face.

Lib'aj chi k'ut xk'astaj chi u wach
Ri jun winaq kumal.
Nim chiki'kot u k'u'x
Ta xk'astaj u wach.

They marveled at it therefore
Lords.

Xkimayijaj k'ut
Ajawab'.

“Sacrifice now surely therefore yourselves,
We would see it.

“Chipusu' chi na k'u iwib',
Chiqil taj.

Truly desire our hearts the your dance,”
Said again therefore lords.

Qitzij kurayij qa k'u'x ri i xajoj,”
Xecha' chi k'u ajawab'.

“Good then that, you lord,”
They said therefore.

“Utz b'a la', at ajaw,”
Xecha' k'ut.

Then also they sacrificed themselves.
He therefore was sacrificed,

K'ate puch xkipus kib'.
Are' k'u xpus,

The Xhunahpu
By Xbalanque.

Ri Xjunajpu
Rumal Xb'alanke.

Each one therefore
Was cut in pieces

Jujunal k'u

His legs,
His arms.

Raqan,
U q'ab'.

Came off his head,
It was placed out far away.

Xel u jolom,
Xk'ole' aponoq chi naj.

Was dug out his heart,
Was placed on its face leaf.

Xk'otix uloq u k'u'x,
Xch'eqe' chuwach tz'alik.

They are drunk therefore these,
All its lords Xibalba at sight.

Keq'ab'ar k'u ri',
Ronojel rajawal Xib'alb'a chi ka'y.

Merely therefore one other goes on dancing,
The Xbalanque.

Xa k'u jun chi kaxajowilab'ik,
Ri Xb'alanke.

The manuscript reads xcasta, likely a scribal error for xcastah. See line  where it is written properly.

---
Immediately again therefore was revived his face.

“Kawa'lijoq!” xcha' k'ut.
Lib'aj chi k'ut xk'astaj u wach.

Greatly they rejoice.
Merely like they rejoice lords,
Merely they doing it.
Rejoice their hearts

Nim keki'kotik.
Xa wi keje' keki'kot ajawab',
Xa wi are' keb'anowik.
Kaki'kot ki k'u'x

One Death,
Seven Death.

Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame.

Like these they dance,
They sense it.

Keje' ri' are' kexajowik,
Kakina'o.

THEN also their desire,
Its abandonment also their hearts lords

K'ATE puch u rayinik,
U malinik pu ki k'u'x ajawab'

To their dances Xhunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Chire ki xajoj Xjunajpu,
Xb'alanke.

Then came out therefore their words One Death,
Seven Death:

Ta xel k'u ki tzij Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame:

“Do it to us!
Sacrifice us!” they said therefore.

“Chib'ana' chiqe!
Kojipusu'!” xecha' k'ut.

“The same way sacrifice us,”
They said therefore

“Junal taj kojipusu',”
Xecha' k'ut

One Death,
Seven Death

Jun Kame,
Wuqub' Kame

To the Xhunahpu,
Xbalanque.

Chike ri Xjunajpu,
Xb'alanke.

“Good then that, they will be revived your faces.
Are not you death?

“Utz b'a la', chik'astaj i wach.
Ma pa ix k'o kam?

We also gladdeners yours,
You also their lords

Oj pu ki'kotirisay iwe,
Ix pu rajawal

---
Your servants,”

Iwal,
I k'ajol,”

They said therefore
To lords.

Xecha' k'ut
Chike ajawab'.

This therefore first to be sacrificed,
The truly its head lord,
One Death
His name,
Its lord Xibalba.
Dead now therefore One Death.

Are' k'u nab'e xpus,
Ri qi u jolom ajaw,
Jun Kame
U b'i',
Rajawal Xib'alb'a.
Kaminaq chi k'ut Jun Kame.

Then was seized next Seven Death.
Not were revived again their faces.

Ta xchap chik Wuqub' Kame.
Mawi xk'astaj chi ki wach.

Then also they go out
Xibalbans by their feet.

K'ate pu kelik
Xib'alb'a chi kaqan.

These saw the lords,
They died.

Are' xkil ri ajawab',
Xekamik.

They torn now out,
They also torn open both of them.

E xaraxoj chub'ik,
E pu xaraxoxinaq ki kab' ichal.

Merely therefore punishment their faces
They did.

Xa k'u k'ajisab'al ki wach
Xb'anik.

Straightaway they executed the one lord,
Not surely they revived again his face.

Ju suk' xukamib'ej ri jun ajaw,
Ma na xkik'astaj chi u wach.

He therefore the one lord begged humbly surely,
He wept surely before their faces the dancers.

Are' k'u ri jun ajaw xelaj na,
Xoq' na chikiwach ri e xajol.

Not he accepted it,
Not as well he found it.

Mawi xuk'ulu,
Ma pu xuriqo.

“Pity my face,”
He said when he sensed himself.

“Toq'ob' nu wach,”
Xcha' ta xuna' rib'.

They finished therefore going all their vassals,
Their servants in great canyon.

Xek'is k'u b'ek ronojel kal,
Ki k'ajol pa nima siwan.

---
In great ravine.
There therefore they piled up.
Then gathered therefore
Not counted ants swarmed hither,
They go into canyon
Like they were driven hither,

Xa jun xkib'alij wi kib'
Pa nima xolob'achan.
Chiri' k'ut e tub'ul wi.
Ta xk'ulun k'ut
Mawi ajilan chi sanik tukuliy ula,

Keje' ri' xeb'eyo'x uloq,

Then they arrived therefore.
They bowed down
To give now themselves all of them.

Ta xe'ul k'ut.
Xkixul
Ki ya' chi kib' konojel.

They arrived begging humbly,
They arrived also weeping.

Xe'ul elajoq,
Xe'ul pu oq'oq.

Thus they were defeated
Its lords Xibalba.

Keje' k'ut kech'akatajik
Rajawal Xib'alb'a.

Merely miracle,
Merely also their transformation themselves when
they did it.

Xa mayijab'al,
Xa pu ki jalwachib'al kib' ta xkib'ano.

Then also they named their names,
They named themselves before their faces all Xibalba.

K'ate puch ta xkib'i'j ki b'i',
Xkikob'isaj kib' chikiwach konojel Xib'alb'a.

“HEAR our names!
We shall name them.
We shall name also
Their names our fathers to you.

“CHITA' qa b'i'!
Xchiqab'i'j.
Xchiqab'i'j nay puch
U b'i' qa qajaw chiwe.

We this.
We

These therefore our fathers
These you killed:

Are' k'u qa qajaw

One Hunahpu,
Seven Hunahpu their names.

Jun Junajpu,
Wuqub' Junajpu ki b'i'.

---
Their afflictions the our fathers.

Oj k'u paq'ol re wa'e ki ra'il,
Ki k'axk'ol ri qa qajaw.

Thus we endured
All afflictions you did to us.

Keje' k'ut mi xqakuyu wi
Ronojel k'axk'ol mi xib'an chiqe.

Thus we destroy all of you.
We kill you.

Keje' k'ut kixqasach wi iwonojel.
Kixqakamisaj.

There is not now ones who get saved of you,”
They were told therefore.

Maja b'i chik kolotajel chiwe,”
Xe'uchax k'ut.

Then also they beg humbly,
They weep all Xibalba.

Not great was their day anciently,
Merely they wanted conflict people anciently.

She therefore weeps,
Cries out the their grandmother

Before the unripe maize ears
That they planted behind.

Chuwach ri aj

It came its sprout the unripe maize ears.
Then it dried up again,
This therefore when they were burned in pit oven.
Then came again therefore its sprout the unripe maize ears.

Xpe u tux ri aj.

Then therefore burned the their grandmother,

She burned the copal incense before the unripe maize ears, Xuk'at ri pom chuwach ri aj,
Its remembrance theirs this.
It rejoiced her heart their grandmother

This for second time came up its sprout the unripe maize.

Then she named it therefore:
Center House,
Center Ancestral Plot,
Revitalized Unripe Maize Ears,
Leveled Earth
Its name became.

Ta xub'i'natisaj k'ut

This therefore she named Center House,
Center Ancestral Plot,

Are' k'ut xub'i'naj wi Nik'aj Ja,

Because merely at its center
Its interior their home they planted unripe maize ears.

Rumal xa chu nik'ajal

This again therefore she named Leveled Earth,

Are' chi k'u xub'i'naj wi Ch'atam Ulew,

Upon level earth

This also she named Revitalized Unripe Maize Ears
Because it came up its sprout unripe maize ears.

They planted it behind

They saw now therefore
His face the their father

Xkil chi k'ut

He spoke now their father to them,
When they defeated Xibalba.

Xch'aw chik ki qajaw chike,

THIS therefore his adornment now their father by them
When they adorned the Seven Hunahpu.

WA' k'ute u wiqik chik ki qajaw kumal

There they went to adorn them
At Crushing Ballcourt.

Chila' xb'e ki wiqa wi

Merely only his face they wanted it to become.
Was asked therefore to him its name everything:

Xa wi xere u wach xraj uxik.
Xtz'onox k'ut chire u b'i' ronojel:

His mouth,
His nose,
Its seeds his face.

U chi',

He found first his name,
Merely therefore little more was said.
Merely not he said more
Its name the its equivalent things above his mouth.

Xuriq nab'e u b'i',
Xa k'u sqaqi'n chik xcha'taj wi.

But also it had been said now,
Thus then they honored him.

Xere pu xcha'taj chi wi,

Left behind his heart their father.
Merely he was left at Crushing Ballcourt

Kanajoq u k'u'x ki qajaw.
Xa wi xkanaj chi Puk'b'a[l] Cha'j.

“There you are called upon.
It will come to be,”

“Chiri' kixsik'ix wi.

They said again his sons to him.
Then was comforted his heart.

Xecha' chi u k'ajol chirech.
Ta xku'b'ax u k'u'x.

“First they will go out to you,
First also you are worshiped

“Nab'e chel iwe,

Rumal saqil al,

They said to their father
When they comforted his heart.

Xecha' chirech ki qajaw

“Merely we avengers your death,

“Xa oj paq'ol i kamik,

Thus their counsel
When was defeated all Xibalba.

Keje' k'ut ki pixab'ik

Then they rose up therefore hither,
Here center lights.
Straightaway therefore
They rose up to sky.

Ta xe'aq'an k'u loq,

One therefore sun,
One also moon to them.

Then was illuminated its womb sky,
Its face earth.

Ta xsaqirik u pam kaj,

In sky they were.
They therefore at last rose up,

When was searched for as well what will enter its flesh

There are now their wives when truly were brought to life. K'o chi kixoqil ta qi xek'astajik.
Soon rejoiced now their hearts because of their companions.Anim xki'kot chik ki k'u'x rumal ki k'ulel.
These therefore their names,
Their wives these:

Are' k'u ki b'i',

His wife Balam Acab;

Rixoqil Majukutaj;

These therefore their names
Their wives.

Crowded therefore became the bloodletters,

Tzatz k'ut xuxik ri aj k'ix,

Not surely merely four now came to be,
Only four the their mothers we Quiché people.

Ma na xa e kajib' chik xuxik,

Different then their names,
Each one of them.

Jalajoj chi ki b'i',

Then they were multiplied,
There at its coming out sun.
Truly their names came to be the people:
Sovereign,

Would be called now their names people.
There its coming out sun
They were multiplied.

The manuscript reads cauiquib, although the more common spelling in the text is cavequib. The Popol Vuh manuscript contains
variant spellings of a number of these lineage names. I have followed the spelling that is most commonly used in each case for the English
translation.

---
As it was awaited the sun.

E xa k'u xkos ki k'u'x chiri'

Many then all nations,

“Merely let’s go,

This therefore first went out the Tohil,

Borne in his pack frame,
Carried by Balam Quitze.
Went out therefore hither Auilix,

He carried Balam Acab.
Hacavitz next,
Its name god
He received Mahucutah.
Nicacah Tacah,

He received Iqui Balam.

Merely only Tohil to Tamub,
There is its name they received
Their grandfather,

Third therefore Ilocab only Tohil.

THUS their naming three Quichés,
But they freed themselves,

Crowded they would walk,
They arrived at Tulan.

There was not therefore fire.
Only there are the Tohil.
This therefore the their god nations
First they created their fire.

Ma k'u ja b'i q'aq'.

“Alas, there is not our fire came to be,
We shall die because of cold,”

“Akarok, maja b'i qa q'aq' mi xuxik,

---
Then spoke therefore the Tohil:

Xecha' k'ut.
Ta xch'aw k'ut ri Tojil:

“Do not mourn.
There is yours

“Mixb'isonik.
K'o iwech

Should you lose the fire.
I say,” said therefore Tohil to them.

Chisach ri q'aq'.

“Not truly you god?
You our provisioning.
You as well our strengthening.
You our god.”

“Ma qitzij at k'ab'awil?
At qa tzuquj.
At pu qa ko'on.
At qa k'ab'awil.”

They said to him when they gave thanks for this.
Said Tohil:

Xecha' chire ta xkik'amowaj ri'.
Xub'ij Tojil:

Good then that,
Truly I your god,
Then be it so.
I your lord,
Then be it so,”

“Utz b'a la',
Qitzij in i k'ab'awil,
Ta chuxoq.
In iwajawal,
Ta chuxoq,”

They were told the bloodletters,
Sacrificers by Tohil.

Xe'uchaxik ri aj k'ixb',
Aj k'ajb' rumal Tojil.

This therefore their glory the nations.
They rejoice because of their fire.

Are' k'ut ki q'aq'al ri amaq'.
Keki'kotik rumal ki q'aq'.

THEN also then began great rain
When burned brightly their fire nations.

K'ATE puch ta xtikarik nima jab'
Are katilo u q'aq' amaq'.

Thick therefore with hail fell on their heads all nations.
Then went out therefore their fire because of hail.

Tzatz k'ut chi saqb'och xqajik pakiwi' ronojel amaq'.
Ta xchup k'ut ki q'aq' rumal saqb'och.

There was not their fire came to be.
Then they pleaded for then therefore their fire

Maja b'i chik ki q'aq' xuxik.
Ta xkitz'onoj chi k'ut ki q'aq'

The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab:

Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab':

---
Truly we are finished because of cold,”

“At Tojil,
Qitzij kojutzinik rumal tew,”

They said therefore to Tohil.
“Fine, do not mourn,” said Tohil.

Xecha' k'ut chire Tojil.
“Utz, mixb'isonik,” xcha' Tojil.

Then he brought forth fire,
He twist drilled hither inside his shoe.

K'ate ta xrelesaj q'aq',
Xub'ak uloq chupan u xajab'.

Then therefore they rejoiced
The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.
Then therefore they were warmed.

K'ate k'ut xeki'kot
Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',

K'ate k'ut xemiq'ik.

While therefore extinguished again their fire nations
They are finished again because of cold.

Are k'ut chupinaq chik u q'aq' amaq'
Ke'utzin chik rumal tew.

Then also their coming again
Pleaders for their fire

K'ate pu ki petik chik

With the Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Not therefore they could bear it again because of cold,
Hail.

Ma k'u kakich'ij chik rumal tew,

Only they shudder now,
They tremble now as well,
There is not life on them,
They shiver now

Xa kelexlot chik,

Not they grasp now,
When they arrived.

---
We shall ask for then its tiny little bit your fire,”

“Ma qi kojk'ix na iwuk',
Chiqatz'onoj ta u koq' sqaqi'n i q'aq',”

They said when they arrived;
There was not therefore their being welcomed.

Xecha' ta xe'ulik;
Ma k'u ja b'i xek'ulaxik.

Then cursed therefore their hearts the nations.
Different now their language

Ta xk'oqon k'u ki k'u'x ri amaq'.

The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

“Alas, is it abandoned our language?
What did we do?

“Akarok, a xkanaj wi qa ch'ab'al?

We are lost.
Where were we deceived?

Only also one our germination,

They said therefore all nations

Xecha' k'ut konojel amaq'

Then showed therefore himself
A person

[Demon speaking from here on]

[Demonium loquens cis]

Before their faces the Balam Quitze,

Chikiwach ri B'alam Kitze,

This is a singular instance in which Ximénez glosses the text with a brief comment in Latin, referring to the messenger from Xibalba
as a demon, or devil. That Ximénez chose to do this only once and in Latin argues for the overall accuracy of the Maya text as he
transcribed it.

---
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

Said therefore
The its messenger Xibalba:

Xcha' k'u

“Truly then he your god this.

“Qitzij chi are' i k'ab'awil ri'.

He also their substitute,
Remembrance theirs,

Are' pu u k'exwach,

Not you give therefore their fire the nations
Unless first they give to Tohil.

Miya' k'u ki q'aq' ri amaq'
K'u na chikiya'o chire Tojil.

Not you desire they give to you.
Ask surely to Tohil to him surely,

Miajawaj chikiya' chiwe.
Chitz'onoj na chirech Tojil chire na,

You shall come
They shall give it,

Chipe wi

Said the Xibalban.

Xcha' ri Xib'alb'a.

There are his wings
Like the its wings bat.

K'o u xik'

“I messenger by Framer yours,
Shaper yours,” said therefore the Xibalban.

“In samajel kumal Tz'aqol iwe,
B'itol iwe,” xcha' k'u ri Xib'alb'a.

They rejoiced then therefore,
Became great then in their hearts

Xeki'kot chi k'ut,
Xnimar chik chi ki k'u'x

The Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz, when spoke the Xibalban.

Ri Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz, ta xch'aw ri Xib'alb'a.

Suddenly then therefore he lost himself before their faces, Lib'aj chi k'ut xusach rib' chikiwach,

---

Mawi xma'inik.

Then they arrived again therefore
The nations.

Ta xe'ul chi k'ut
Ri amaq'.

They were finished then because of cold,
Thick with hail,
With blackened rain,
Hoar frost as well,
Not counted cold.

Ke'utzin chik rumal tew,
Tzatz chi saqb'och,
Chi q'eqal jab',
Saqb'oqom puch,
Mawi ajilan tew.

They cover themselves up,
They bend over,
They crawl on hands and knees now,

Kakik'u'lu,
Keluklutik,
Kechakchot chik,

Because of cold
All of nations.

Rumal tew
Ronojel amaq'.

Then they arrived there
They are

Ta xe'ul chiri'

Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

Great its trouble
Their hearts.

Nim u q'atat
Ki k'u'x.

Sorrowful their mouths,
Sorrowful their faces.

Chikimaj ki chi',
Chikimaj ki wach.

THEN also they arrived again
Thieves

K'ATE puch kulik chik
E eleq'om

Before their faces Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Chikiwach B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

“Not truly you shall pity our faces?

“Ma qi chitoq'ob'aj qa wach?

---

Chiqatz'onoj ta u koq sqaqi'n i q'aq'.

Not discovered,
Not therefore found.

Mawi xuk'ulu,
Ma pu xuriqo.

Not also only one our home?
Only as well one our mountain

Ma pu xa jun qochoch?
Xa pu jun qa juyub'al

When you were framed,
When you were shaped.

Ta xixtz'aqik,
Ta xixb'itik.

Pity then therefore our faces,”
They said therefore.

Chitoq'ob'aj ta k'u qa wach,”
Xecha' k'ut.

“What therefore will you give to us
Should we pity therefore your faces?” they were asked
therefore.

“Naqi la' k'u chikuya'o chiqe
Chiqatoq'ob'aj k'u i wach?” xe'uchax k'ut.

“Fine, we will give precious metal to you,”
They said therefore the nations.
“Not we want the precious metals,”
They said therefore

“Utz, chiqaya' puwaq chiwe,”
Xecha' k'u ri amaq'.
“Mawi kaqaj ri puwaq,”
Xecha' k'ut

Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab.

B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab'.

“What truly will you want?
Merely then we ask,” they said therefore the nations.

“Naqi pa qi chiwaj?
Xa ta b'a chiqatz'onoj,” xecha' k'ut ri amaq'.

“Good then that, we will ask first to Tohil,
“Utz b'a la', qatz'onoj na chirech Tojil,
Then therefore we shall tell it to you,” they were told then. K'ate k'ut xchiqab'ij chiwe,” xe'uchax chik.
Then as well they asked to Tohil:
“What will they give the nations, you Tohil?

K'ate puch xkitz'onoj chire Tojil:
“Naqi pa chikiya' ri amaq', at Tojil?

They arrive
To plead for the your fire,”

Kul

They said therefore the Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Xecha' k'u ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

---
To give breast

“Utz b'a la', ma chikaj
Ki tu'nik

Below their arm joints,
Below as well their armpits?

Xe' ki tolok',
Xe' pu ki meskel?

Not desire their hearts they embrace me,
The I Tohil?

Ma karajon ki k'u'x kinkiq'aluj,
Ri in Tojil?

Then not therefore they shall want it,
Not therefore I will give their fire,

Ta ma k'u chiraj,
Ma k'u chinya' ki q'aq',

Says Tohil,’
You say to them.

Kacha' Tojil,
Kicha' chike.

‘It will begin therefore,
Not surely today they gave breast

‘Katikal na k'ut,
Ma na kamik taj xkitu'nik

Below their arm joints,
Their armpits.

Xe' ki tolok',
Ki meskel.

Says to you,’
You say,”

Kacha' chiwech,’
Kixcha',”

They were told therefore Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Xe'uchax k'ut B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

Then they said therefore
His word Tohil.

Ta xkib'ij k'ut
U tzij Tojil.

“Good then that, to give breast,
Fine as well that we embrace him,” they said therefore.

“Utz b'a la', chitu'nik,
Utz puch chiqaq'aluj,” xecha' k'ut.

Then they responded,
They accepted as well his word Tohil.

Ta xkichokob'ej,
Xkik'ulub'a' puch u tzij Tojil.

Not they increased again.
“Fine,” only straightaway they said.

Mawi xkik'iyalaj chik.
“Utz,” xa ju suk' xecha'.

---
Then they were warmed.

Ta xkik'am k'ut q'aq',
K'ate xemiq'ik.

Only therefore one group
These only stole away fire in smoke.

Xa k'u ju ch'ob'
Ri' xa xreleq'aj ub'ik q'aq' pa sib'.

This the Bat House.
Chamal Can its name their god,

Are' ri Sotz'ila Ja.
Chamal Qan u b'i' ki k'ab'awil,

Cakchiquels.
Merely bat its image.

Kaqchekeleb'.
Xa sotz' u wachib'al.

When they passed through smoke.
Softly moving they passed by

Ta xe'ik'o pa sib'.
Chilib'lotik xe'ik'owik

When they arrived to take fire.
Not they asked for their fire the Cakchiquels,

Ta xul u k'ama' q'aq'.
Mawi xutz'onoj u q'aq' ri Kaqchekeleb'

Not they gave themselves in defeat.
But they were defeated the nations all

Mawi xuya' rib' chi ch'akik.
Xere xch'akajataj ri amaq' ronojel

When they gave its beneath their arm joints,
Its beneath their armpits

Ta xuya'o u xe' u tolok',
U xe' u meskel

To be given breast.
This therefore his being given breast that he said Tohil.

Chi tu'xik.
Are' k'ut u tu'xik ri xub'ij Tojil.

Then were sacrificed all nations before him,
Then were carved out hither their hearts

Ta xpus ronojel amaq' chuwach,
Ta xk'otix uloq u k'u'x

At their arm joints,
At their armpits.

Chu tolok',
Chu meskel.

Not as yet attempted
Its doing.

Maja chitijowoq
U b'anik.

Then it was foreseen by Tohil
Its taking as well,

Ta xnik'wachixik rumal Tojil
U k'amik puch,

Glory,
Majesty,

Q'aq'al,
Tepewal,

---
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam,

Kumal ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam,

There having come from Tulan
Zuyva.

Chila' petenaq wi Tulan

Not therefore they eat,
Never ending fast they did.

Ma k'u kewa taj,
Junelik mewajik xkib'ano.

But they fix their eyes on the its dawn,
They observe its coming out hither sun.

Xere kiselawachin ri u saqirik,
Kilawachin relik ula q'ij.

They occupy themselves in looking for the Great Star,
Passes Before Sun its name.

Kejalow kib' chi rilik ri Nima Ch'umil,
Ik'oq'ij u b'i'.

This first before its face sun,
Then it will be born the sun.

Are' nab'e chuwach q'ij,
Ta chalaxoq ri q'ij.

Green Passes Before Sun.
Always therefore there it is its face

Raxa Ik'oq'ij.
Amaq'el k'u chila' k'o wi ki wach

At its coming out sun.
When they were there,

Chi releb'al q'ij.
Ta xek'oje' chila',

Zuyva its name,

Tulan
Suywa u b'i',

Came their gods.
Not surely only then at last here

Xpe wi ki k'ab'awil.
Ma na xa ta k'a waral taj

They received their glory,
Their lordship as well.

Xkik'am wi ki q'aq'al,

But rather there they were conquered,
They were humiliated,

Xawi chila' xch'ataj wi,
Xyoq'otaj wi,

Great nations,
Small nations.

Nima amaq',
Ch'uti amaq'.

Then they were sacrificed

Ta xpusik

---

Chuwach Tojil.

They gave their blood,
Their blood flow,

Xuya'o u kik'el,
U k'omajil,

Their arm joints,
Their armpits all people.

U tolok',
U meskel ronojel winaq.

Straightaway at Tulan came their glory.
Great knowledge there is with them.

Ju su chi Tulan xpe wi ki q'aq'al.
Nima eta'mab'al k'o kuk'.

In darkness therefore,
In night as well they did it.

Chi q'equ'mal k'ut,
Chi aq'ab'al puch xkib'ano.

They came then therefore,
They were pulled up then hither there.

Xepe chi k'ut,
Xeb'oqotaj chi ula chila'.

They left behind then
Its coming out sun.

Xkikanaj chik
Releb'al q'ij.

“Not this our home this.
Only let us go to see surely we will begin,”

“Mawi are qochoch wa'.
Xa jo' chiqil na kojtike' wi,”

Said therefore the Tohil.
Truly he would speak

Xcha' k'u ri Tojil.
Qitzij chich'awik

To Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam:

Chikech B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam:

“You give thanks first behind,
You shall carry out your responsibilities first therefore,
Its piercing your ears,
You shall prick your elbows,
You petition.
This your way of giving thanks before his face god.”

“Kixk'amowan na kanoq,
Chitaja' na k'ut,
U jutik i xikin,
Chit'isa' i ch'uk,
Kixqajb'oq.
Are' i k'amowab'al chuwach k'ab'awil.”

“Good then that,” they said therefore.
Then they pierced their ears.

“Utz b'a la',” xecha' k'ut.
Ta xkijut ki xikin.

The manuscript reads chiziza, which is apparently a scribal error for chitiza.

---
Their coming from Tulan.
Wept their hearts
When they came,
Then they wept
Behind Tulan.

Xoq' k'ut chupan ki b'ix
Ki petik Tulan;
Xoq' ki k'u'x
Ta xepetik,
Ta xkoq'otaj
Kanoq Tulan.

“Alas, not here we shall see its dawn,
When it will be born the sun,
Illuminator its face earth,”

“Akarok, mawi waral xchiqil wi u saqirik,
Ta chalaxoq ri q'ij,
Saqirisay u wach ulew,”

They said therefore,
When they came therefore.

Xecha' k'ut,
Ta xpe k'ut.

Only therefore remained these on road,
Only there were people remaining there.

Xa k'u xukanajib'ej ri' pa b'e,
Xa xk'o wi winaq chikanaj chiri'.

They sleep each one of nations,
They rest hither.

Kewar wi jujun chi amaq',
Keyakataj wi uloq.

Always therefore they would look for the star,
Its sign sun.
This its sign its dawn in their hearts,
When they came there its coming out sun.

Amaq'el k'ut chikil ri ch'umil,
Retal q'ij.
Are' retal u saqirik chi ki k'u'x,
Ta xepetik chila' releb'al q'ij.

Truly same face
They passed over hither

Qi junam wach
Xe'ik'ow ula

There Honor,
Respect, it is said today.

Chila' Nim,
Xol, kab'ixik wakamik.

THEN they arrived as well there on its top a mountain,
There they gathered themselves

TA xe'ul puch chiri' chuwi' jun juyub',
Chiri' xkikuch wi kib'

All Quiché people,
With nations.

Konojel K'iche' winaq,
Ruk' amaq'.

There therefore they arrived all of them.

Chiri' k'u xe'opon wi konojel.

The manuscript reads xepopon, which is apparently a scribal error.

---

Ta xkipixab'aj kib'.

Its naming mountain today Chi Pixab,
Its name mountain

U b'i'nam juyub' wakamik Chi Pixab',
U b'i' juyub'

They gathered themselves.
There therefore they gave names to each other:

Xekuchu wi kib'.
Chiri' k'ut xkikob'isaj wi kib':

“I this:
I Quiché person.
You therefore this:
You Tamub.
This your name shall come to be,”
They were told the Tamub.
Said to then therefore Ilocab:
“You Ilocab.
This your name that shall come to be.

“In wa':
In K'iche' winaq.
At k'u ri':
At Tamub'.
Are' a b'i' chuxik,”
Xuchax ri Tamub'.
Xcha' chi k'ut Ilokab':
“At Ilokab'.
Are' ri' a b'i' ri chuxik.

Not lost three then Quichés.
Only same our word,” they said therefore

Mawi sachel oxib' chi K'iche'.
Xa junam qa tzij,” xecha' k'ut

When were placed their names,
THEN they named now therefore

Ta xkoj ki b'i',
TA xb'i'naj chi k'u

The Cakchiquels,
Cakchiquels their name came to be.
With also Rabinals,
This then therefore their name came to be.
Not lost today.
This then therefore the Ah Tziquinahas,
Their name today.

Ri Kaqchekeleb',
Kaqchekeleb' u b'i' xuxik.
Ruk' chik Rab'inaleb',
Are' chi k'u u b'i' xuxik.
Mawi sachinaq wakamik.
Are' chi k'u ri Aj Tz'ikina Ja,
U b'i' wakamik.

These therefore their names.
These that spoke among themselves

Are' k'u ki b'i'.
Ri' xkib'ij chi kib'il kib'

There first,
They arrived.

Chiri' na,
Xe'opon wi.

Merely they would await first its dawn.
They would look for its coming out hither star.

Xa chikoyob'ej na u saqirik.
Chikilawachij relik ula ch'umil.

This first,

Are' nab'e,

---

Chuwach q'ij.

Then may it be born.

Ta chalaxoq.

“There we came,
Only we split apart ourselves,”

“Chila' xojpe wi,
Xa xojpaxin qib',”

They said
Among themselves.

Xecha'
Chi kib'il kib'.

This would preoccupy their hearts,
These great affliction they passed through hither.

Are' chiq'atatat wi ki k'u'x,
Ri' nima k'axk'ol xe'ik'ow wi uloq.

There is not food,
There are not staples.

Maja b'i wa,
Maja b'i echa'.

Only its bottom their staffs they would sniff,
Like it they eat they would feel.

Xa u xe' ki ch'ami'y chikisiqo,
Keje' ri' kewa'ik chikina'o.

But not they eat
When they came.

Xma kewa wi
Ta xepetik.

Not therefore clear
Their passing through hither in sea.

Ma k'u q'alaj
Ki ik'owik uloq pa palo.

Like there was not sea they passed through hither.
Only on its top stones they passed through hither.

Keje' ri' maja b'i palo xe'ik'ow wi uloq.
Xa chuwi' taq ab'aj xe'ik'ow wi uloq.

There were here the stones on sand.
Then they named it therefore:

K'oleje' ula ri ab'aj pa sanayeb'.
Ta xkib'i'natisaj k'ut:

Lined Up Stones,
Piled Up Sand its name.

Cholochik Ab'aj,
B'oqotajinaq Sanayeb' u b'i'.

By these they passed over hither
Inside sea,
Its dividing itself water,
They passed through hither.

Kumal ri' xe'ik'ow wi uloq
Chupan palo,
U jachon rib' ja',
Xe'ik'ow wi uloq.

This therefore would preoccupy their hearts,
When they took counsel together.

Are' k'ut chiq'atatat wi ki k'u'x,
Ta xepixab'an kib'.

---
One beverage they would drink.
This only one of maize grains,
There therefore borne

Chi maja b'i ki wa.
Ju uk' chikiqumej.
Ri' xa juna ixim,
Chiri' k'ut eqal wi

On its top mountain,
Chi Pixab its name.

Chuwi' juyub',
Chi Pixab' u b'i'.

Only therefore they had carried
The Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Xawi k'u kuk'a'am
Ri Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

Great fast they do the Balam Quitze
With his wife,
Cahapaluna
Her name his wife;
Just as he did Balam Acab
With his wife,
Chomiha
Her name;
With also Mahucutah great fast there is
With his wife,
Tzununiha
Her name;
With Iqui Balam,
Caquixha
Her name
His wife.

Nima mewajik kakib'an ri B'alam Kitze

These therefore fasters these in darkness,
In night.

Are' k'ut e aj mewa ri' chi q'equ'mal,
Chi aq'ab'al.

Great their sorrow when they were on its top mountain,
Chi Pixab its name today.

Nim ki b'is ta xek'oje'ik chuwi' juyub',
Chi Pixab' u b'i' wakamik.

Spoke then therefore their gods there.
THEN spoke therefore with

Xcha' chi k'ut ki k'ab'awil chiri'.
TA xcha' k'ut ruk'

Tohil,

Tojil,

---
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Chikech ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Akab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

“Only then we go,
Only then as well we arise.

“Xa ta kojb'ek,
Xa ta pu kojyakatajik.

Not then here we are to be,
In hiding may you place us.

Ma ta waral kojk'oje' wi,
Chi ewal taj kojiya' wi.

Not approaches its dawn?
Not in pity your faces

Mi xyopij u saqirik?
Ma pa toq'ob' i wach

If we become spoils by warriors?
Build this we are to be with you,

We kojkanab'ixik rumal aj lab'al?

You bloodletters,
Sacrificers.

Ix aj k'ixb',

Each one then therefore
Place us,”

Jujun ta k'ut

They said therefore
When they spoke.

Xecha' k'ut
Ta xech'awik.

“Good then that, only we are pulled up
To search the forests,” they said therefore all of them.

“Utz b'a la', xa kojb'oqotajik
Qa tzukuj taq ri k'eche'laj,” xecha' k'ut konojel.

Then as well they took
To be carried on the back their gods each one to them.

K'ate puch xkik'am

Then entered therefore Auilix in canyon,
Its having been named Hidden Canyon,

Ta xok k'ut Awilix pa siwan,
U b'i'nam Ewab'al Siwan,

Called by them in great canyon at forest.
Pa Auilix its name today.

Chuchax kumal pa nima siwan chi k'eche'laj.
P[a] Awilix u b'i' wakamik.

There was left,
Was therefore left in canyon by Balam Acab.

Chiri' xkanaj wi,
Xk'u kanajoq pa siwan rumal B'alam Aq'ab'.

---
Its first this.

Cholom u kanajik,

Left then therefore Hacavitz on its top a great fire house.
Hacavitz its name mountain today.

Xkanaj chi k'ut Jaq'awitz chuwi' jun nima q'aq' ja.
Jaq'awitz u b'i' juyub' wakamik.

They made it their citadel therefore this came to be.
There therefore was god,

Xkitinamit k'u ri' xuxik.
Chiri' k'ut xk'oje' wi k'ab'awil,

Hacavitz his name.
Not was left the Mahucutah with his god,

Jaq'awitz u b'i'.
Xawi xkajnaj ri Majukutaj ruk' u k'ab'awil, 

Second therefore god
That was hidden by them.

U kab' k'ut k'ab'awil
Ri xewax kumal.

Not surely in forest was Hacavitz.
Merely cleared mountain was hidden Hacavitz.

Ma na pa k'eche'laj xk'oje' wi Jaq'awitz.
Xa saqi juyub' xewax wi Jaq'awitz.

Then came next therefore Balam Quitze,
He arrived there in great forest.

Ta xpe chi k'ut B'alam Kitze,
Xul chiri' pa nima k'eche'laj.

Arrived to be hidden Tohil by Balam Quitze.
Pa Tohil is called today its name mountain.

Xul ewaxa wi Tojil rumal B'alam Kitze.
Pa Tojil chuchax wakamik u b'i' juyub'.

Then they gave name the hidden canyon
Healing Tohil.

Ta xkikob'isaj ri ewab'al siwan
Kunab'al Tojil.

Crowded with snakes,
Crowded as well with jaguars,

Tzatz chi kumatz,
Tzatz puch chi b'alam,

Rattlesnakes,

K'an Ti',

There in forest they were,
Hidden

Chiri' pa k'eche'laj xek'oje' wi,

Only therefore one there was

Iqui Balam.
Only one awaited its dawn.

Only therefore enters its midst

Only one they arose,
Only as well one dawn,
Only one they awaited

Great Star,
Passing Before Sun its name.

“First it will go out hither
Before its face sun,

“Nab'e chel uloq

They said.

Ta saqiroq,”
Xecha'.

Only therefore one
They were

There is not their sleep,
Their rest.

Maja b'i ki waram,

Great its weeping their hearts,
Their bowels,

Nim roq'ej ki k'u'x,

To its dawn,
Its becoming clear as well.

Chire u saqirik,
U pakatajik puch.

Only there surely penitent their faces
They came

Xawi chila' xk'ixb' wi u wach

Great sorrow,
Great humility.

Nima b'is,

They would tremble because of their affliction
They passed through hither.

E chik'arinaq rumal u k'axk'ol

“Not sweet we came.
Alas!

“Mawi kus mi xojpe wi.

Would that we could behold its birth sun.
What it we have done?

Oj taj xkojilowik ralaxik q'ij.

Same our faces at our mountains,
Only we have changed our natures,” they say.

Junam qa wach chi qa juyub'al,
Xa xqok'otaj qib',” kecha'.

The x- prefix in this instance is a marker of surety.

The manuscript reads xa eqovi, likely a scribal error for xe eqovi.

---
On its top sorrow,
On its top humility,
On its top as well weeping,
Crying out,
They spoke.

Ta k'i kech'awik chi kib'il kib',

These therefore comforted the gods

Only in bromeliads,
Only in hanging moss they were.

Not surely on flat stones
They were given.

They speak first

Great also their breath,

Crowded their spirit essence,
Crowded as well their pathways,

Their victorious means to chill,
To frighten their existence

But therefore there they were
In forest.

There was place of dawning
At Tohil,
At Auilix,
At Hacavitz, called today.

Are saqirib'al

There therefore they were sown,
They dawned,

Balam Acab,

NIM k'ut xeki'kotik B'alam Kitze,

When they saw the Passes Before Sun.
First it went out hither,

Ta xril ri Ik'oq'ij.
Nab'e xel uloq,

It would glitter its face,
Chitiltotik u wach,
When it came out hither first therefore before its face sun. Ta xel uloq nab'e k'ut chuwach q'ij.
Then therefore they unwrapped their copal incense there,
Having come from its coming out sun.

K'ate k'ut ta xkikir ki pom chila',
Petenaq wi releb'al q'ij.

Then its victory in their hearts
When they opened it.

K'ate u ch'ak chi ki k'u'x

Three of them their way of giving thanks
In their hearts.

Ox ichal ki k'amowab'al

Mixtam Copal Incense
Its name copal incense
Had carried Balam Quitze;
Cavistan Copal Incense

Had carried Balam Acab;

Had carried Mahucutah.

There are their copal incenses.

These therefore they burned
When they waved censers outward

Are' k'ut xkik'ato

There,
Its coming out sun.

Releb'al q'ij.

Bitterly they wept
When they waved censers
They burned their copal incense,

Quz keoq'ik
Ta xesaqb'isanik.
Xkik'at ki pom,

---
Then therefore they wept when not they saw it,

Loq'olaj pom.
K'ate k'ut xkoq'ej ri mawi xkilo,

Not also they witnessed its birth sun,
Then also when it came out hither sun

Ma pu xkiwachij ralaxik q'ij,
K'ate puch ta xel ulo q'ij

They rejoiced small animals,
Great animals.

Xki'kotik ch'uti chikop,

They came up hither from path river,
From canyons.

Xk'isyakataj uloq pa b'e ya',
Pa siwan.

They were there
Point mountains.

Xek'oje'ik
Tza'm taq juyub'.

Only one they went their faces there
Came out hither sun.

Xa jun xkixe wi ki wach chila'
Xel wi uloq q'ij.

Then they cried out pumas,
Jaguars.

K'ate ta xe'oq'ik koj,

First therefore sang the bird,
Parrot its name.

Nab'e k'ut xoq' ri tz'ikin,
K'eletzu u b'i'.

True that they rejoiced all animals.
They spread their wings,

Qitzij chi xki'kot ronojel chikop.
Xkirip ki xik',

Eagle,
White vulture,

Kot,
Saq k'uch,

Small birds,
Great birds.

Ch'uti tz'ikin,

Therefore they were kneeling the bloodletters,
Sacrificers.

E k'u xukuxuxinaq ri aj k'ixb',

Greatly they rejoice with their bloodletters,
Their sacrificers,

Nim keki'kotik ruk' raj k'ixb',

However many of nations there are today,
Not counted people,

Jarub' pa chi amaq' k'o wakamik,
Mawi ajilan chi winaq,

Only one dawned
All nations.

Xa jun xsaqir wi
Ronojel amaq'.

Then as well was dried its face earth by the sun.
Like the one person the sun when it revealed itself.

K'ate puch xchaqijik u wach ulew rumal ri q'ij.
Keje' ri' jun chi winaq ri q'ij ta xuk'ut rib'.

Hot his face
Thus he dried

K'atan u wach

Soggy as well
Its face earth not yet come out hither sun.

U wach ulew maja chela ula q'ij

U wach ulew maja chela ula q'ij.

Only therefore ascended upward the sun,
Like the one person.

Xa k'u xka'oj aq'anoq ri q'ij,
Keje' ri' jun chi winaq.

Not therefore was endured his heat.
Ma k'u xch'ijitajik u k'atanal.
Only therefore his self/revelation when he was born.Xa k'u u k'utb'al rib' ta xalaxik.
Only then therefore its mirror that was left.
Not true this now sun that appears,

Xa chi k'u u lemo' ri xkanajik.

Because of the biting animals:

Not surely then many people in their existence,
Only they few when they were there

Ma na e ta k'iya winaq chi ki k'oje'ik,

On its top mountain

There they dawned,
There as well they burned.

They waved censers outward
There at its coming out sun they came.

Chila' xepe wi B'alam Kitze,

There then they multiplied on its top mountain,
Where therefore their citadel came to be.

Chiri' k'ute xek'iyar wi chuwi' juyub',

There therefore it was
When truly appeared

Everthing beneath sky.

U wach ulew,

There therefore began their song,
“Our Burial” its name.

Chiri' k'ut xtikar wi ki b'ix,
“Qa Muqu” u b'i'.

---
Only its weeping their hearts,
Their bowels.
They said within their song:

Xkib'ixaj,
Xa roq'ej ki k'u'x,
Ki pam.
Xkib'ij chupan ki b'ix:

“Alas we were lost!
At Tulan we split apart ourselves.

“Akarok xojsachik!

We left behind then our older brothers,
Our younger brothers,

Xeqakanaj chik qatz,

Where did they see sun?
Where they were when it dawned?”

Awi mi xkil wi q'ij?
Awi on e k'o wi ta mi xsaqirik?”

They said to them their bloodletters,
Their sacrificers Yaqui people.

Xecha' chire raj kixb',

“Merely only Tohil his name
Their god Yaqui people.

“Xawi xere Tojil u b'i'

We separated there at Tulan

When we had left hither,
When also its completion our faces when we came,”

They said among themselves
When they remembered then out

These dawned there

“We left them behind,” they said.
Great its trouble their hearts

“Xeqakanaj kanoq,” xecha'.

There
On its top Hacavitz.

Just like they did that of Tamub,

Xawi keje' kakib'an ri rech Tamub',

Merely only they were there in forest,
Nation Dan its name.

Xawi xere e k'o wi chiri' pa k'eche'laj,

Dawned their bloodletters,
Their sacrificers,

Merely only Tohil,

Only therefore merely then his name

A little bit its change his name.
“One Toh” it is called his name
Their god Rabinals.
Only therefore say this,

“Jun Toj” chuchaxik u b'i'

Xa k'u cha' ri',

Only would desire to make the same in Quiché,
In their speech.

Xa chiraj junamataj chi K'iche',

There therefore was changed speech with Cakchiquels,

Are k'ut jalk'atajinaq wi ch'ab'al ruk' Kaqchekeleb',

This is a rare instance where the scribe used D as a sign for T' in the manuscript.

Only therefore made different their language today.

With as well behind their god,
They had received

Ruk' nay puch chirij u k'ab'awil,

Their lineage:

Only their god changed their speech
When given hither their god there Tulan.
Behind stone changed their speech
When came from Tulan in the darkness.

Xawi u k'ab'awil xjalk'atij wi u ch'ab'al

Placed its name

Xa k'u jun xawax wi ronojel amaq',

Only one they were four of them:

THIS therefore their burning beneath then as well,
Offerings as well Tohil.

WA' k'ute ki k'atonik u xe' chi puch,

When went therefore before his face Tohil,

They went to see,
Went as well to worship,

Xeb'e kila',
Xb'e pu ki q'ijila',

They gave thanks then before its face
To its dawn.

Not therefore great this they had carried
Their burning as well

Ma k'u nim ri' kuk'a'am

Only its remnants pitch,
With pericon flowers,

When gave hither their knowledge the bloodletters,

Then they spoke:

“Only here our mountain,
Our plain shall come to be.

“Xawi waral qa juyub'al,

Great as well our birth,

Nim qa q'ij,

Because of all people yours,

Only therefore we your companions then surely,

Xawi k'u oj iwachb'il chi na,

Only we shall give your knowledge.
Do not reveal us before their faces the nations

Come then to give a little their blood to us.
Pity our faces.

Chul ta iya' sqaqi'n u kik'el chiqech.

Leave behind therefore its skin the deer to guard them.
These the disguises
You will deceive behind,
This its deer will come to be.

This therefore then therefore the bundle deer before their

Not you reveal as well yourselves.

Birds in their mouths the stones,

Beverage blood by gods.

Straightaway spoke the stones
When they arrived,

When they would go to give
Their burnings.

Ta chib'e ki ya'

Only like again they would do it
Before its face the bundle deer:
They would burn pine resin,
They would burn as well pericon flowers,
Head mushroom,

Not their dwelling
The their homes in sun.

Mawi ki laqab'en

Only in mountains

These therefore they would eat:

Mere its child wasp,
Mere as well its child bee,
They would search for.

Are' k'ut chikecha'j:

Not first very good food,
Very good water then as well.

Not clear its pathway their homes.
Not clear where they are left behind their wives.
There therefore crowded now the nations,
Each one would unite,
They gather then themselves,
The each of groups of nations
They were tumultuous then on roads.
Clear then their path.

When therefore then they would see the nations
As they would pass by on road.

Are k'ut ta chikil ri amaq'

Then therefore they cry out hither
Peak mountains.

K'ate k'ut ta ke'oq' uloq

Only as well its cry fox would they cry out;

Xa pu roq'ib'al yak chikoq'ib'ej;

Only as well its cry puma,
Jaguar they would do.

Xa pu roq'ib'al koj,

When they would see it the nations,
Much would be said:

Ta chikil ri amaq',
K'i chub'ixik:

“Only coyote the their cry,
Only as well fox this,

“Xa utiw ri koq'ik,
Xa pu yak ri',

Only puma,
Only jaguar,” say therefore the nations.

Xa koj,
Xa b'alam,” kecha' k'ut ri amaq'.

Like the not person in their hearts the all nations,
Only therefore deception theirs nations.

When they would do it, it is desire their hearts
Ta chikib'ano k'o karaj ki k'u'x
This not surely true then they would be frightened to do it. Ri ma na qitzij ta chixib'in ta rib' chikib'ano.
This they desire to it its cry puma,
Its cry jaguar they would cry out.

K'o kakaj chire roq'ib'al koj,
Roq'ib'al b'alam chikoq'eb'ej.

Then they would see therefore the people only one,
Only two would go, they would desire to destroy them.

Ta chikil k'u ri winaq xa jun,
Xa kaib' chub'inik chikaj ki ma'ij chikech.

Each day then they arrive then therefore there
At their homes with their wives.
Merely its child hornet,
Its child wasp,
Merely as well its child bee therefore,
They carried to give to their wives.
Each day then they went then therefore

Ju ta q'ij ta ke'ul chi k'ut chiri'
Chi kochoch ruk' kixoqil.
Xawi ral wonon,
Ral sita'l,
Xa pu ral aqaj k'u,
Kuk'a'am chikiya'o chirech kixoqil.
Ju ta q'ij ta xeb'e chi k'ut

Before his face Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Chuwach Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

The manuscript reads chubinic (would walk), likely a scribal error for chubixic (would be said).

---
In their hearts,

Xecha' k'ut
Chi ki k'u'x,

“This the Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz,

“Are' ri Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz,

Only its blood deer,
Birds we give to them.

Xa u kik'el kej,
Tz'ikin kaqaya' chire.

Only we have pricked our ears,
Our elbows.

Xa qasisa qa xikin,
Qa ch'uk.

We have pled for our strength,
Our endurance,

Qa tz'onoj qa kowil,
Qa ch'ijilal

To Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Chire Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

Who may take care of their death the nations?
Only then each one we kill them?”

Naqi taj chikuch'aj ki kamik ri amaq'?
Xa ta jujunal keqakamisaj?”

They said to each other
When they went therefore before their faces

Xecha' chi kib'il kib'
Ta xeb'e k'ut chuwach

Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

Then they pricked their ears,
Their elbows before their faces gods.

Ta xkisis ki xikin,
Ki chu'k chuwach k'ab'awil.

They scooped up the their blood,
They rubbed it inside in their mouths the stones.

Xkiwakuj ri ki kik'el,
Xkijik' koq pu chi' ri ab'aj.

Not therefore true that stones they come to be.
Like the each boys

Ma k'u kitzij ta chi ab'aj chuxik.
Keje' ri' e jujun chi k'ajolab'

When they arrive.
They rejoiced then

Ta ke'ulik.
Xeki'kot chik

---
Sacrificers.

Chirech ri ki kik'el aj k'ixb',
Aj k'ajb'.

Then it came then therefore its sign
Their deeds this:

Ta xpe chi k'ut retal
Ki b'anoj ri':

“Conquer many lands.
This your liberation self.

“Chich'ako'nisaj k'i je'.
Are' i kolb'al iwib'.

There it came from Tulan
When you brought us hither,”

Chila' xpe wi chi Tulan
Ta xojik'am uloq,”

They were told therefore.
Then was given hither

Xe'uchax k'ut.
Ta xya' uloq

The breast
At Staggering its name.

Ri tz'um
Pa Silisib' u b'i'.

With blood would enter behind it,
To rain self the blood,

Ruk' kik' chok chikij,
Ki jab' rib' ri kik',

Came to be his giving
Tohil,
With Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Xuxik u ya'on
Tojil,
Ruk' Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

THIS its beginning now their being abducted people,
Nations,

WA'E u tikarik chik releq'axik winaq,
Amaq',

By Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Kumal B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

THEN as well their being killed nations these.
They took them thus:

K'ATE puch u kamisaxik amaq' ri'.
Are' xkik'am ri':

Only one would go walking,
Only two would go walking.

Xa jun chub'inik,
Xa kaib' chub'inik.

---
Thus then they would go to sacrifice them

Mawi q'alaj ta chkik'amo.
K'ate k'ut ta chib'e ki pusu'

Before their faces Tohil,
Auilix.

Chuwach Tojil,
Awilix.

Then therefore they would give blood on road,
There is their skulls they would place on road.

K'ate k'ut ta chikiya' kik' pa b'e,
K'olik u jolom chikik'olob'a' pa b'e.

They say therefore the nations, “Jaguar ate them,”
Only they say.

Kecha' k'ut ri amaq', “B'alam mi xti'owik,” 
Xa kecha'.

Because like the paws jaguar
Their feet then they would make.

Rumal keje' ri raqan b'alam
Kaqan ta chikib'ano.

Not would they reveal themselves.
Crowded with nations they abducted.

Mawi chikik'ut kib'.
Tzatz chi amaq' xkeleq'aj.

Until its long time therefore
They felt themselves nations.

K'a u najt k'ut
Xuna' wi rib' amaq'.

“Perhaps these the Tohil,
Auilix enter to us.

“We are' ri Tojil,
Awilix kok chiqe.

Only we seek them the bloodletters,
Sacrificers,

Xa keqatzukuj ri aj k'ixb',
Aj k'ajb',

When it they are at their homes.
Let us follow their feet,”

Ta la k'o wi kochoch.
Chiqataqej ri kaqan,”

They said therefore all nations
When they gathered their thoughts among themselves.

Xecha' k'ut konojel amaq'
Ta xkik'am ki na'oj chi kib'il kib'.

Then therefore they began
Its following their feet

K'ate k'ut xkitikib'a'
U taqexik kaqan

The bloodletters,
Sacrificers.

Ri aj k'ixb',
Aj k'ajb'.

Not therefore clear, only feet deer,
Only feet jaguars they would see.

Ma k'u q'alaj, xa raqan kej,
Xa raqan b'alam chikilo.

---
Nowhere there was clear

Mawi q'alaj kaqan.
Xma k'o wi q'alaj wi

Where first their feet the only their paws,
Like this their feet only confusion its

Are nab'e kaqan ri xa ki pich,
Keje' ri' kaqan xa sachb'al re

By them.
Not clear their path.

Kumal.
Mawi q'alaj ki b'e.

Only would be created clouds,
Only would be created dark rain,
Only as well would be created mud,
Only would be created drizzling rain.

Xa chiwinaqir sutz',
Xa chiwinaqir q'eqal jab',
Xa pu chiwinaqir xoq'ol,
Xa chiwinaqir musmul jab'.

They would see it
Before their faces nations.

Chikilo
Chikiwach amaq'.

Only therefore they would weary their hearts seeking them, Xa k'u chikos ki k'u'x chikitzukuxik,
Then they would mourn as well.
Ta chikoq'otaj puch.
Because great their essence
The Tohil,

Rumal nim u k'oje'ik
Ri Tojil,

Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

Long time therefore they did it there on its top mountain,
On its edges the nations.

Najt k'ut xkib'an chiri' chuwi' juyub',
Chuxikin ri amaq'.

They killed.
This then was created the abduction,
Murderous assaults,
When they would take the nations on roads.

Xkikamisaj.
Are' ta xwinaqir ri eleq'ik,
E ch'alami q'at,
Ta chikik'am ri amaq' pa taq b'e.

They would sacrifice them
Before their faces

Chikipus
Chuwach

The Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Ri Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

Saved therefore their sons there

Xkolo k'ut ki k'ajol chiri'

---

Chuwi' juyub'.

Where were Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Are Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

Three boys their appearance they would walk,
Only their spirit essence the stones.

Oxib' chi k'ajolab' ki wachib'al keb'inik;
Xa u nawal ri ab'aj.

There was a river,
Where they bathe

Xk'oje' jun ja',
Are ke'atin wi

There
At its mouth river.

Chiri'
Chuchi' ja'.

Only their self manifestation.
It gave its name therefore:

Xa ki k'utb'al kib'.
Xub'i'naj k'ut:

At His Bath Tohil,
Its name river came to be.

Chi Ratinib'al Tojil,
U b'i' ja' xuxik.

Many times therefore they would see them nations.
Suddenly then they would be lost themselves.

K'iya mul k'ut chikilo amaq'.
Lib'aj chi chikisachix taj kib'.

When they were seen
By nations.

Ta ke'ilik
Rumal amaq'.

Then would come to be its report
Where they are

Ta xux taj u tzijel
Ri e k'o wi

The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

This therefore this its gathering their thoughts nations
So that they may be killed.

Are' k'u wa' u k'amik u na'oj amaq'
Chire u kamisaxik taj.

FIRST therefore they desired
To plan nations their defeat

NAB'E k'ut xraj
Ki na'ojij amaq' u ch'akik

---
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

They spoke all the bloodletters,
Sacrificers before their faces nations.

Xecha' ronojel ri aj k'ixb',
Aj k'ajb' chuwach amaq'.

They assembled themselves,
They summoned as well each other all of them.

Xkejek kib',
Xketaq pu kib' konojel.

There was not one group,
Two groups then now left behind of them.

Maja b'i ju ch'ob',
Ka ch'ob' ta chik xkanaj chike.

All of them gathered themselves,
They summoned as well each other.

Konojel xekuchu kib',
Xetaqo pu kib'.

Then were gathered their thoughts,
They spoke therefore,
They asked themselves:

Ta xk'am ki na'oj,
Xecha' k'ut,
Ta xkitz'onob'ej kib':

“What would ensure their defeat
The Cavec Quiché people?

Naqi pa chi kuchaj ki ch'akik
Ri Kaweq K'eche' winaq?

Because ended our children of mothers,
Sons of men.

Rumal mi xk'is qal,

Not clear
Its loss people by them.

Mawi q'alaj

If we are finished by abduction,
Then it shall come to be

If this great
His glory

The Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz,

Ri Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz,

This then therefore our god
The Tohil shall come to be.

Are' ta k'ut qa k'ab'awil
Ri Tojil chuxik.

---
Not will be successful they defeat us.

Chiqanab'ij taj.
Mawi chutzinik kojkich'ako.

Not then we many people we are?
These therefore the Cavec not how many are they?”

Ma pa oj k'iya winaq chiqak'oje'ik?
Are' k'u ri Kaweq mawi jarub' chikik'oje'ik?”

They said therefore
When they arrived all of them.

Xecha' k'ut
Ta xeponik konojel.

Said then part of them
To them the nations when they spoke:

Xcha' chik chajkar
Chikech ri amaq' ta xech'awik:

“Who are these perhaps they bathe
At its mouth river every day?

“Apachina ri' lo ke'atin
Chuchi' ya' ju taq q'ij?

If these Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz,

We are' Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz,

These we defeat surely first.
There then therefore shall begin their defeat

Are' taq keqach'ak na nab'e.
Chiri' ta k'ut chitikar wi ki ch'akatajik

The bloodletters,
Sacrificers,”

Ri e aj k'ixb',
E ah k'ajb',”

They said therefore part of them again
Then they spoke:

Xecha' chi k'ut chajkar chik
Ta xech'awik:

“How therefore will we defeat them?” they said then
therefore.
“This then our means of defeating them will come to be:

“Naqi la' k'ut chiqach'akb'ej kech?” xecha' chi k'ut.

Because the boys they appear
When they are seen at river,

Rumal ri e k'ajolab' kewachinik
Ta ka'ilitaj chi a',

They go then therefore two maidens.
These then the truly then chosen,
They then fairest of maidens.
May they therefore be objects of desire to them,”
they said therefore.

Keb'e ta k'ut e kaib' q'apojib'.
Are' ta ri qitzij chi e cha'om,
E ta saqloq'oj chi q'apojib'.
Chib'e ta k'ut ki rayb'al chire,” xecha' k'ut.

“Good then that, only then we search for then two

“Utz b'a la', xa b'a keqatzukuj e ta kaib'

“Are' ta qa ch'akob'al kech chuxik:

---

Chi utzilaj taq q'apojib',” xecha' k'ut.

Then they sought therefore their daughters.
These the truly fairest maidens.

Ta xkitzukuj k'ut ki me'al.
Are' ri qitzij e saqilaj taq q'apojib'.

Then they were instructed therefore the maidens:
“Go you our daughters to wash the clothes at river.

Ta xkipixab'aj k'ut ri q'apojib':

“Kixb'ek ix qa mi'al ojich'aja' ri k'ul chi ya'.

If therefore then you see them the three boys,
Undress therefore yourselves before their faces.

We k'ut ta ke'iwil ri e oxib' k'ajolab',
Chisonob'a' k'u iwib' chikiwach.

If therefore will desire their hearts to you,
You offer yourselves.

We k'ut chirayin ki k'u'x chiwe,
Kixchoko.

‘We come then after you,’
When they say to you,

‘Kojopon ta chiwij,’
Ta kecha' chiwech,

‘Yes,’ you say therefore,
When you are petitioned therefore.

‘We',’ kixcha' k'ut,
Ta kixtz'onox k'ut.

‘Where from you come,
Where are they by whom daughters?’

‘Apa kixpe wi,
Apa aj choq' mi'al?’

Then you say, ‘we their daughters lords,’
You say therefore to them.

Ta kecha', ‘Oj ki mi'al ajawab',’
Kixcha' k'u chike.

‘Come therefore their sign by you.’
Then something they will give to you.

‘Chipe k'u retal iwumal.’
Ta naqi la' chikiya' chiwe.

If they will desire your faces,
Truly you will give yourselves to them.

Taseq chikirayij i wach,
Qitzij chiya' iwib' chikech.

If therefore then not you will give yourselves,
We kill you therefore.

We k'ut ta mawi chiya' iwib',
Kixqakamisaj k'ut.

Then good our hearts
When there is their sign you will bring hither.
This therefore their sign to our hearts
When they come after you,”

K'ate utz qa k'u'x
Ta k'o retal chik'am uloq.
Are' k'u retal chi qa k'u'x

Said therefore the lords,
When they were instructed the maidens.

Xecha' k'u ri ajawab',
Ta xepixab'ax ri q'apojib'.

---
This their names these:
Lady Lust her name one maiden,
Lady Weeping then therefore her name one other.
They as well two,
Lady Lust,
Lady Weeping,
Their names.

They were sent thither to river,
To Their Bath

Xetaq ub'ik chi ya',

Tohil,
Auilix,

Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

This their thought all nations these.
THEN as well they went.

Are' ki na'oj ronojel amaq' ri'.
K'ATE puch xeb'ek.

They were adorned in finery.
Truly then beautiful they would appear

Xekawuxik.
Qitzij wi chi jeb'elik chiwachinik

When they went there
Where bathes Tohil.

Ta xeb'ek chila'

They carry on their heads therefore
The their wash when they went.

Kikarilo'on k'u
Ri ki ch'ajo'n ta xeb'ek.

They rejoice then therefore the lords
Because of the two their daughters they sent thither.

Keki'kot chi k'u ri ajawab'
Kumal ri e kaib' ki mi'al xkitaq ub'ik.

When they arrived therefore at river
Then they began to wash.

Ta xe'opon k'ut chi ya'
K'ate xkitikib'a' ch'ajo'nik.

They undressed themselves each of them,
On their hands and knees before their faces stones.

Xkitzonob'a' kib' ki kab' ichal,
E chakachaxinaq chuwach taq ab'aj.

Then they gathered therefore
The Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz.

Ta xek'ulun k'u
Ri Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz.

---
Only therefore a little they passed by their faces

Xe'opon chila' chuchi' ya'.
Xa k'u sqaqi'n xrok'o'ib'ej ki wach

The two maidens they washed.
These therefore the maidens only straightaway they were
ashamed.

Ri e kaib' q'apojib' kech'ajo'nik.
Are' k'u ri q'apojib' xa ju su xek'ixb'ik.

When they arrived the Tohil,
Not therefore went their desire the Tohil

Ta xe'opon ri Tojil,
Ma k'u ja b'i xb'e ki rayib'al ri Tojil

To the
Two maidens.

Chirech ri

Then they were asked therefore:
“Where do you come from?”

Ta xetz'onox k'ut:
“Apa kixpe wi?”

They were asked to them
The two maidens.

Xe'uchaxik chirech
Ri e kaib q'apojib'.

They were asked:
“What do you want

Xe'uchaxik:
“Naqi pa kiwaj.

You come here
At its mouth our river?”

Kixul waral
Chuchi' wi qa a'?”

They were asked therefore.
“We then sent hither by lords,

Xe'uchax k'ut.
“Oj b'a taqon uloq kumal ajawab',

Then we came.
‘Go to see

Ta xojpetik.
‘Chib'e iwila'

Their faces the Tohil,
Speak with them,’ they said lords to us.

Ki wach ri Tojil,
Kixch'aw kuk', xecha' ajawab' chiqe.

‘Thus may it come its sign
Truly if you shall see their faces,

Keje' k'ut chipe wi retal

We were told,”
They said therefore

Xojojuchaxik,”
Xecha' k'u

The two maidens

Ri e kaib' q'apojib'

---

Ta xkisuk'ub'a' ki taqikil.

This then therefore they desired the nations:
They were violated then the maidens

Are' ta k'u xkaj ri amaq':
Xejox ta ri q'apojib'

By their spirit essences Tohil.
They said therefore the

Rumal ki nawal Tojil.
Xecha' k'u

The Tohil,
Auilix,
Hacavitz,

Ri Tojil,
Awilix,
Jaq'awitz,

When they spoke then to the Lady Lust,
Lady Weeping,

Ta xech'aw chik chikech ri Xtaj,

Their names
The two maidens:

Ki b'i'
Re e kaib' q'apojib':

“Good you shall take its sign our word with you.
You shall wait for it first to give it out there to lords,”

“Utz chib'ek retal qa tzij iwuk'.
Chiwoyob'ej na chiya' apanoq chikech ajawab',”

They were told therefore.
Then as well their thinking now

Xe'uchax k'ut.
K'ate puch ki na'ojinik chik

The bloodletters,
Sacrificers.

Ri aj k'ixb',
Aj k'aj'b'.

They were told the Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam:

Xe'uchax ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam:

“Paint three robes,
Write its sign your essence.

“Kixtz'ib'anoq oxib' k'ul,
Chitz'ib'aj retal i k'oje'ik.

It shall arrive with nations,
It shall go with the two maidens

Chopon kuk' amaq',
Chib'e kuk' ri e kaib' q'apojib'

They are washing.
Give thither to them,”

Kech'ajo'nik.
Chiya' ub'ik chike,”

They were told therefore

Xe'uchax k'ut

---
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah.

B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj.

THEN therefore they painted three of them.
First he painted the Balam Quitze.
Jaguar its image came to be
He painted on its face robe.
This therefore the next Balam Acab.
Eagle now its image
He painted on its face robe
Then he painted next therefore the Mahucutah.
Everywhere hornets,
Everywhere wasps,
Their images his painting,
He painted on its face robe.
They completed therefore their paintings three of them,
Three forms they painted.
Then therefore then they went to give robes

K'ATE k'ut xetz'ib'anik kox ichal.

The Lady Lust,
Lady Weeping their names.

They said therefore
The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah.

Xecha' k'u
Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj.

“This its sign your word
You arrive before their faces lords.

“Wa'e retal i tzij

‘Truly he spoke the Tohil to us,’ you say.
‘Qitzij xch'aw ri Tojil chiqech,’ kixcha'.
‘This therefore its sign we brought hither,’ you say to them. ‘Wa'e k'u retal xqak'am uloq,’ kixcha' chike. 
They will wear them therefore
These robes you will give to them,”

Chikiq'u'j k'u
Ri' k'ul chiya' chike,”

They were told therefore the maidens
When they instructed them thither.

Xe'uchax k'ut ri q'apojib'
Ta xkipixab'aj ub'ik.

Then they went therefore,

Ta xeb'e k'ut,

---

Xkuk'a'j ub'i ri tz'ib'an k'ul.

Then they arrived therefore,
Straightaway therefore they rejoiced the lords

Ta xe'opon k'ut,
Ju su k'u xeki'kot ri ajawab'

When they saw
Their faces

Ta xil
Ki wach

Hanging from their arms.
They were entreated the maidens:

Xekel u q'a.
Kitz'onoxik ri q'apojib':

“Not you saw his face the Tohil?” they were asked.
“We saw then him,” they said therefore

“Ma xiwil u wach ri Tojil?” xe'uchaxik.
“Xqil b'a la',” xecha' k'u

The Lady Lust,
Lady Weeping.

Ri Xtaj,
Xpuch'.

“Good then that, where its sign you brought hither?
Not true?” they said the lords.

“Utz b'a la', naqi pa retal xik'am uloq?
Ma qitzij?” xech'aw ri ajawab'.

Thus then the its sign their disgrace
They sensed the lords.

Keje' ri' b'a ri retal ki makunik
Xkina' ri ajawab'.

Then were untied therefore
The painted robes by maidens.

Ta xkiritaj k'u
Ri tz'ib'an k'ul kumal q'apojib'.

Everywhere jaguars,
Everywhere eagles,

Jumaj b'alam,
Jumaj kot,

Everywhere as well hornets,
Wasps,

Jumaj nay puch wonon,

Its paintings inside robes
They would shine brightly their faces.

U tz'ib'al u pam k'ul

Then they desired therefore their faces.
Then they put them on around them.

Ta xkirayij k'ut u wach.
K'ate xkikoj chikij.

There was not therefore it did the jaguar,
Its painting at first around lord.

Ma k'u ja b'i xub'an ri b'alam,
U tz'ib'al nab'e'oq chirij ajaw.

The manuscript reads cat, likely a scribal error or a shortened version of cate.

---
Eagle its painting.
Kot u tz'ib'al.
Only good he felt lord inside.
Only he turned about before their faces.

Xa utz xuna' ajaw chupan.
Xawi kasolowik chikiwach.

He disrobes his covering
Before their faces all of them.

Katz'onon u q'u'xik
Chikiwach konojel.

Then it entered next therefore
Third painted robe about lord.

Ta xok chi k'ut
Rox tz'ib'am k'ul chirij ajaw.

This the hornets,
Wasps its interior.

Are' ri wonon,
Sita'l u pam.

He put it on therefore about him.
Then as well now was stung his body

Xukoj k'u chirij.
K'ate puch ta xti'ik u tio'jil

By hornets,
Wasps.

Rumal wonon,
Sita'l.

Not he bore it.
Not as well he endured the stinging insects.

Mawi xch'ijtajik.
Ma pu xkuyutaj ri ti'ob'al chikop.

Then therefore broke open therefore his mouth lord
Because of insects

Ta k'u xuraquj k'ut u chi' ajaw
Rumal chikop

Only painted their images
Within robes

Xa tz'ib'am ki wachib'al
Chupan k'ul

His painting Mahucutah therefore,
Third painting.

U tz'ib' Majukutaj k'u,

Then they were defeated.
Then as well their rebuking

Ta xech'akataj wi.
K'ate puch ki yajik

Maidens these
By lords,

Q'apojib' ri'
Rumal ajawab',

The Lady Lust,
Lady Weeping their names:

Ri Xtaj,
Xpuch' ki b'i':

---
That you have brought hither?

“Naqi pa chi k'ulal,
Ri iwuk'a'm uloq?

Where did you go to get them
You deceivers?”

Apa xb'e i k'ama' wi

They were asked the maidens
When they were rebuked.

Xe'uchax ri q'apojib'
Ta xeyajik.

They were defeated then therefore
The all nations by Tohil.

Kich'akatajik chi k'u
Ri ronojel amaq' rumal Tojil.

This then they desired,
Went then to gratification Tohil

Are' ta xkaj,
Xb'e ta ki'ib'al wi Tojil

Behind Lady Lust,
Lady Weeping.

Chikij Xtaj,
Xpuch'.

They then scratchers knee they came to be,
To its heart nations temptations then they come to be.

E ta joxol ch'ek xe'uxik,
Chuk'u'x amaq' taqchi'b'al ta kexuxik.

Not therefore accomplished
Their defeat

Ma k'u xb'anatajik

Because of enchanted people
The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah.

Rumal e nawal winaq
Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj.

Then they thought again therefore
All nations:

Ta xena'ojin chi k'ut
Ronojel amaq':

“How do we do it to them?
Truly great their nature then it shall come to be,”

“Naqi pa kequch'aj?
Qitzij nim ki k'oje'ik ta chuxoq,”

They said therefore.
Then they gathered again their thoughts:

Xecha' k'ut.
Ta xkikuch chik ki na'oj:

“Only then we pursue them,
We kill them.

“Xa ta keqokib'ej,
Keqakamisaj.

---
With shields.

Chiqawiq qib' chi ch'ab',
Chi pokob'.

Are not we many?
Not there are

Ma pa oj k'i?
Ma ja b'i

One,
Two now we shall leave to them,”

Jun,
Kaib' chik chiqakanaj chike,”

They said therefore.
Then they gathered their thoughts.

Xecha' k'ut.
Ta xk'am ki na'oj.

Only they adorned themselves all nations.
Crowded with killers
When they were gathered all nations,
Killers.

Xa xuwiq rib' ronojel amaq'.
Tzatz chi kamisanel
Ta xemolotajik ronojel amaq'
E kamisanel.

Where therefore there are the Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Are k'ut e k'o ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,

Where are on its top mountain.
Hacavitz its name mountain they are.

Are e k'o chuwi' juyub'.
Jaq'awitz u b'i' juyub' e k'o wi.

They placed therefore their sons there
On its top mountain.

Xk'olo k'ut ki k'ajol chiri'
Chuwi' juyub'.

Not then many people.
Not first thus then

Mawi e ta k'iya winaq.
Ma na keje' ta

Their number this,
Its number nations.

Ki k'iyal ri',
U k'iyal amaq'.

Only a little its top mountain
They occupied.

Xa sqaqi'n u wi' juyub'
Ki q'atem.

For that reason then was planned
Their being killed by nations.

Xa k'u cha' ta xna'ojix
Ki kamisaxik rumal amaq'.

Then they gathered themselves all of them,
They arrived,

Ta xkikuch kib' konojel,

---
THIS then their gathering themselves all nations,

Xetaqo kib' konojel.
WA'E k'ute ki molowik kib' konojel amaq', 

Adorned now with arrows,
With shields all of them.

E kawutal chik chi ch'ab',
Chi pokob' konojel.

Not counted precious metal their adornment.
Beautiful their appearance

Mawi ajilan chi puwaq ki kawub'al.
Jeb'ejoj ki wachib'al

All lords,
Warriors.

Konojel ajawab',
Achijab'.

Truly makers their words all of them.
Truly their slaves they will become.

Qitzij b'anoj ki tzij konojel.
Qitzij e kalab'il chuxik.

“This therefore the Tohil,
This god,

“Are' k'u ri Tojil,
Are' k'ab'awil,

This as well we shall worship.
But then we shall capture him,” they said among
themselves.

Are' pu chiqaq'ijila'.
Xere ta chiqakanab'ij,” xecha' chi kib'il kib'.

But therefore he learned of it the Tohil.
They learned of it as well

Xawi k'u kareta'maj ri Tojil.

The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah.

Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj.

They hear it
When planned by them.

Kakita'o
Ta kana'ojixik rumal.

There is not their sleep,
Their rest.

Maja b'i ki waram,
Ki yakalem.

They adorned therefore all warriors,
Thus they were raised up all warriors,

Xekawutaj k'ut ronojel cha aj lab'al,
K'ate k'ut xeyakatajik ronojel aj lab'al,

At night.
They believed in their hearts.

Chaq'ab' taj.
Xkokib'ej chi ki k'u'x.

Then they went,

Ta xeb'ek,

---

Ma k'u xe'oponik.

Only in road they slept
All the warriors.

Xa pa b'e xewaraj wi
Konojel ri aj lab'al.

Then as well their defeat again
By the Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah.

K'ate puch ki ch'akatajik chik
Kumal ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',

Only therefore one they slept in road.
There was not again they sensed themselves.

Xa k'u jun xewaraj wi pa b'e.
Maja b'i chik xkina' chi kib'.

They were finished with sleep all of them.
Then therefore its beginning

Xek'iswarik konojel.
K'ate k'u u tikarik

Its plucking their eyebrows,
With their whiskers.

U mich'ik ki muquwach rumal,

Then untied therefore the precious metal
From their clothing,

Ta xkir k'u ri puwaq

With their headdresses
With also their necklaces.

Ruk' ki yachwach,
Ruk' puch ki chachal.

This therefore the its neck their staffs
Only they took the precious metal

Are' k'u ri u qul ki ch'ami'y

Punishment their faces,
Only as well plucking to them,

K'ajisab'al ki wach,
Xa pu mich'b'al kech,

Done its sign
Its greatness Quiché people.

Xb'anik retal

Then as well they arose.
Straightaway they reached out for

K'ate puch xek'astajik.
Ju su xkichapala'

Their headresses
With its neck their staffs.
There is not now precious metal on neck,
With their headdresses.

Ki yachwach
Ruk' u qul ki ch'ami'y.
Maja b'i chi puwaq chi qul,
Ruk' ki yachwach.

---
By whom were we plucked?

“Naqi pa mi xojk'amowik?
A'on chi naq mi xojmich'owik?

Where they came,
Stole our precious metal?”

Apa mi xpe wi,
Mi xeleq'an qa puwaq?”

They said therefore
All warriors:

Xecha' k'ut
Konojel aj lab'al:

“These then the perhaps deceivers,
They abduct people.

“Are' la' b'a ri lo e k'axtok',
Ke'eleqan winaq.

Not therefore will be successful
We shall be frightened to them.

Ma k'u chutzinik
Chiqaxib'ij ta qib' chike.

Truly we shall invade their citadel.
Merely only we shall see its face the our precious metal.
We shall make it ours,” they said therefore all nations.

Qi wi chiqokib'ej ki tinamit.
Xawi xere chiqil u wach ri qa puwaq.

Merely only made words all of them.
Merely therefore comfort their hearts

Xawi xere b'anoj tzij konojel.
Xawi k'u ku'b'ul ki k'u'x

The bloodletters,
Sacrificers that are on its top mountain.

Ri aj k'ixb',

Merely only great wisdom
They do

Xawi xere nima na'oj

The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',

Ik'i B'alam.

Then they thought therefore Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

Ta xena'ojin k'ut B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

They made palisade
At its edge their citadel.

Xkib'an k'oxtun
Chuchi' ki tinamit.

Only wood planks,

Xa tz'alam,

---

Xa ch'ut,

They placed
Around their citadel.

Xchikejb'ej
Rij ki tinamit.

Then they made the effigies.
Like the people they came to be by them.

K'ate xkib'an ri poy.
Keje' ri winaq xuxik kumal.

Then they arranged them there
On its top palisade.

K'ate xkichol chiri'
Chuwi' k'oxtun.

Merely only there are their shields.
There are also their arrows.

Xawi xere k'o ki pokob'.
K'o pu ki ch'ab'.

They were adorned.
Entered the headdress precious metal on their heads.

Xekawuxik.
Xok ri yachwach puwaq pa ki wi'.

Entered also therefore mere effigies,
Only as well carved wood.

Xok pu k'u xa poy,
Xa pu ajam che'.

Placed the precious metal of the nations,
This they went to take on road.

Xkojow ri puwaq rech amaq',
Ri' xb'e ki k'ama' pa b'e.

This they adorned effigies by them.
They encircled around citadel.

Are' xukawub'ej poy kumal.
Xekotkomijik chirij tinamit.

Then as well then they entreated
To their thoughts to Tohil.

K'ate puch ta xkitz'onoj
Chi ki na'oj chirech Tojil.

“If we die,
If as well we are defeated?” they asked.

“We kojkamik,
We puch kojch'akatajik?” xecha'.

Wept their hearts
Before his face the Tohil:

Xoq' ki k'u'x
Chuwach ri Tojil:

“Do not mourn.
I am.

“Mixb'isonik.
In k'olik.

This therefore you shall use this to them.
Do not fear.”

Are' k'ut chikoj wa' chikech.
Mixib'ij iwib'.”

They were told the Balam Quitze,

Xe'uchax ri B'alam Kitze,

---
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.

B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj,
Ik'i B'alam.

Then they gave thither the hornets,
Wasps.

Ta xya' uloq ri wonon,
Sita'l.

These therefore they went to gather,
They bore them when they came.

Are' k'ut xb'e ki k'ama',
Kuk'a'am ta xepetik.

Then they gave them inside four great gourds.
Four places they were around edge citadel.

K'ate xkiya'o chupan kajib' nima'q q'oq'ob'.
Kajib' xk'oje' wi chirij tinamit.

They closed up the hornets,
Wasps within great gourds.

Xkitz'apij wi ri wonon,
Sita'l chupan q'oq'ob'.

These weapons
To nations by them.

Are' k'ulelab'al
Rech amaq' kumal.

They were spied on therefore,
They were being watched for in ambush therefore,
Scrutinized as a target their citadel by their messengers
nations.

Xenik'wachix k'ut,
Xemuqche'x k'ut,
Xnik'ox ki tinamit rumal u samajel amaq'.

“Not however many,”
They said therefore.

“Mawi e jarub',”
Xecha' k'ut.

Only therefore came to be seen the effigies,
Carved wood.

Xere k'ut xul kila ri poy,
Ajam che'.

They are still,
They are carrying

Kesilaje'ik,
Kuk'ala on

Their arrows,
Their shields.

Ki ch'ab',
Ki pokob'.

True people they appear,
True then killers they appear

Qitzij winaq kewachinik,
Qitzij chi e kamisanel kewachinik

When they saw nations.
They rejoiced therefore
All nations.

Ta xkil amaq'.

Mawi janik' xkilo.

Crowded the nations there were.
Not counted people.

Tzatz ri amaq' chu k'oje'ik.

Warriors,
Also killers,
Murderers,

To the Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah

Rech ri B'alam Kitze,

There they were on its top mountain.
Hacavitz its name they were.

Are k'o chuwi' juyub'.

When therefore were invaded these
We shall tell it now.

Are k'ut kokib'exik wa'

THERE therefore they are there
Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah,
Iqui Balam.
Only one they are on its top mountain

With their wives,
Their children.

Ruk' kixoqil,
Kalk'u'al.

Then they came therefore all warriors,
Killers.

Ta xepe k'ut ronojel aj lab'al,
E kamisanel.

Not only two eight thousands,
Three eight thousands of nations

Mawi xa ka chuy,
Ox chuy chi amaq'

They encircled
Around citadel.

Xkotkomij
Chirij tinamit.

They yell,
Adorned

Ke'ominik,
E wiqitalik

---
With shields.

Chi ch'ab',
Chi pokob'.

They would break open their mouths,
They clamour,
They rush about,
To shout

Chikiq'osij ki chi',
Kelulutik,
Kechaninik,
Chi ominik

Their mocking,
Their whistling.

Ki yuyub',
Ki xulq'ab'.

Then they entered below citadel.
Nothing therefore they fear

Ta xe'ok chuxe' tinamit.
Ma k'u ja b'i kakixib'ij kib'

The bloodletters,
Sacrificers.

Ri aj k'ixb',
Aj k'ajb'.

Only they look hither at its mouth palisade.
Lined up hither

Xa keka'y uloq chuchi' k'oxtum.
E cholon uloq

With their wives,
Their children.

Ruk' kixoqil,
Kalk'u'al.

Only seated their hearts,
Making sweet words the nations.

Xa ku'l ki k'u'x,
B'anoj kusuy tzij ri amaq'.

Then they ascended therefore before its face mountain.
Only therefore a little now

Ta xe'aq'an k'ut chuwach juyub'.
Xa k'u sqaqi'n chik

Not they achieved its mouth citadel.
Then as well then opened their tops

Mawi ketz'ako'nik chuchi' tinamit.
K'ate puch ta xjaq u wi'

The gourds.
Four there are in citadel.

Ri q'oq'ob'.
Kajib' k'o wi chi tinamit.

Then they went out therefore the hornets,
Wasps.

Ta xe'el k'u ri wonon,

Like the smoke
Then went out from inside the each of gourds.

Keje' ri' sib'
Ta xel chupan ri jujun chi q'oq'ob'.

Finished therefore the warriors

Kutzin k'u ri aj lab'al

---

Rumal chikop.

Alighted on its seeds their faces,
Allighted as well on their noses,

Taqatoj chub'aq' ki wach,
Taqatoj puch chi ki tza'm,

On their mouths,
On their legs,
On their arms.

Chi ki chi',
Chi kaqan,
Chi ki q'ab'.

Where they are they would go to catch them.
Wherever they are they would go to swarm them.

A k'o wi xchib'e ki chapa'.
A'on k'o wi xchib'e ki maja'.

Everwhere there are hornets,
Wasps,

Ronojel k'o wi wonon,
Sita'l,

Alighted to their stinging their eyes,
They would busy themselves swarming.

Taqatoj chu ti'omal u b'aq' u wach,
Xchikilij chu b'uchu.

Numerous insects
About the each of people.

Je taq chikop
Chirij ri jujun chi winaq.

They were disoriented because of hornets,
Wasps.

Xeq'ab'arik rumal wonon,
Sita'l.

Not they were grasped again their arrows,
Their shields.

Mawi xchapataj chik ki ch'ab',

They are hunched over on its face ground,
They scatter.

Kewonk'oyeje'ik chuwach taq ulew,
Kelajajik.

They fell before its face mountain,
There therefore not they sense now.

Xeqajik chuwach juyub',
Are k'ut mawi kakina' chik.

Then they were struck with arrows.
They were chopped with axes.

Ta xekaq' chi ch'ab'.
Xechoy chi ikaj.

Only dry pieces wood
They used on them now

Xa b'olaj che'
Xkikoj chik

Killers.

Xok kixoqil,

Only therefore they returned the part of them now.
Only they went again by legs all nations

Xawi k'u xetzalij ri chajkar chik.
Xa xel chik chi kaqan ronojel amaq'

When they found their first they were finished,
They were killed.

Are xkiriq ki nab'e xe'utzinik,
Xekamisaxik.

Not surely only a few of people died,
Not when died these.

Ma na xa sqaqi'n chi winaq xkamik,
Mawi are xkam wi ri'.

They tormented again to their hearts,
Only therefore insects entered to them.

Xkitzayij chi ki k'u'x,
Xa k'u chikop xok chike.

Not surely therefore it warlike things
They did.

Ma na k'u la' achijilal taj
Xkib'ano.

Not arrows,
Not shields they took.

Mawi ch'ab',
Mawi pokob' taj xek'am wi.

Then they were humiliated all nations.
Only therefore they begged humbly now the nations

Ta xeyoq'otajik ronojel amaq'.
Xa k'u xe'elaj chik ri amaq'

Before their faces
The Balam Quitze,
Balam Acab,
Mahucutah.

Chikiwach
Ri B'alam Kitze,
B'alam Aq'ab',
Majukutaj.

“Pity our faces.
Not then we die,”

“Toq'ob' qa wach.
Ma ta kojkamik,”

They said.
“Good then that,

Xecha'.
“Utz b'a la',

Certainly you obedient will come to be,
You servants,

Xax ix wi kame'l chuxik,

As long as goes sun,
As long as goes light,” they were told.

Chi b'e q'ij,

Thus their defeat

Keje' k'ut u ch'akatajik

---

Ronojel amaq'.

This because of our first mothers,
Fathers.

Ri' kumal qa nab'e chuch,

There it was done on its top mountain,
Hacavitz it has been named today

Chiri' xb'an wi chuwi' juyub',

Where first they planted
There.

Are nab'e xetike wi

They multiplied,
They became many.

Xepoq' wi;
Xek'iritaj wi.

They had daughters,
They had sons on its top Hacavitz.

Xemi'alanik,
Xek'ajolanik chuwi' Jaq'awitz.

They rejoice again when
They defeated

All nations.
There they were defeated on its top mountain.

Thus they did this.
They defeated surely

Keje' k'ut xkib'an ri'.

Ronojel amaq'.

Then therefore seated their hearts.
They spoke to their sons

K'ate k'ut xku'b'e ki k'u'x.
Xetzijon chire ki k'ajol

Approached
They would die.

Xnaqajoq
Kekamoq.

Then truly they desired to die.
This now we shall tell now their death

Ta qi xeraj kamisaxik.

---
Their loss.

XKINA' k'ut ki kamik,
Ki sachik.

Then they gave instructions to their sons.
Not surely then sick,
Not as well groaning from illness,
They breathe heavily from illness not.
Then they left behind their word to their sons.

Ta xepixab'ik chirech ki k'ajol.
Ma na e ta yab',
Ma pu kejilowik,

Ta xkanaj ki tzij chire ki k'ajol.

These their names their sons these,
Two he begotten sons Balam Quitze:

Next therefore two now he begat sons Balam Acab.
These their names these:

Only therefore one he begot son Mahucutah:
Co Ahau his name.

Xa k'u jun xuk'ajolaj Majukutaj:
K'o Ajaw u b'i'.

Three they begot sons.
There are not his sons the Iqui Balam.

E oxib' xek'ajolanik.

These therefore their names their sons these.

Are' k'ut ki b'i' ki k'ajol ri'.

Are' xkipixab'aj kanoq.

Only one they are
The four of them.

Xa jun e k'o wi

They sang
Of affliction their hearts.

Xeb'ixanik.
Chi q'atat ki k'u'x.

They would weep as well their hearts
Within their song.

Choq' pu ki k'u'x
Chupan ki b'ixik.

“Our Burial” its name their song
They sang.

“Qa Muqu” u b'i' ki b'ix
Xkib'ixaj.

Then they instructed therefore to their sons:
“You our sons,

Ta xepixab' k'ut chire ki k'ajol:
“Ix qa k'ajol,

We return as well.

“Therefore you arrived
From far away then mountain,

“Mi k'u xixul

To their wives to each of them.

Ix qixoqil,” xecha'
Chire kixoqil chi ki jujunal.

They were instructed:
“We go to our nation.

Xepixab'ik:
“Kojb'e chi qamaq'.

Mirrored in sky.

Cholan chik Qajawal Kej,

Only returning

Sense us therefore.

Do not sweep us away therefore as well.

You go therefore.

Said therefore
Their word.

Xcha' k'u

When they were instructed.
Then left behind therefore
Its sign,
His existence the Balam Quitze:
“This your remembrance of me.
This I shall leave with you.
This your glory.
This.
I gave instructions,
I pondered,” said therefore
When he left behind
The its sign
His existence.
Bundled Glory
It was called.

Not surely they were buried by their wives,
Their children.

Ma na xemuq taj rumal kixoqil,

Not clear their disappearance,
When they disappeared.

Mawi q'alaj ki sachik,
Ta xesachik.

But clear the their instruction.
Precious therefore the Bundle to them came to be.

Xere q'alaj ri ki pixab'ik.
Loq' k'u ri Pisom chikech xuxik.

This memorial of their fathers.
Only straightaway they burned
Before its face
Their memorial of their fathers.

Are' nab'ab'al rech ki qajaw.

Thus their death

The manuscript reads cui, likely a scribal error or shortened version for co ui.

Ri ki kaj ichal,

First our grandfathers,
Our fathers.

E nab'e qa mam,

Only many they were then
Only they gathered together all of them each day,

Xa k'i e k'o chik

They would remember their father.
Great its day the Bundle to them.

Chikina'b'aj ki qajaw.

Not would they unwrap it.
Only bundled there with them.

Mawi chikikiro.

“Bundled Glory” it was called by them
When it existed.

“Pisom Q'aq'al” chuchaxik kumal

It was named as well their “Wrapping,”
Left behind by their father.

Xb'i'naj puch ki “Q'u'n,”

Only its sign truly
Their existence then they did.

First people
They came from there,

E nab'e winaq

Across sea
At its coming out sun.

Anciently they arrive here.
Then they died elderly now.

Ojeroq ke'ul waral.
Ta xekamik e ri'j chik.

Bloodletters,
Sacrificers they were named.

They remembered
The his instruction their fathers.

Are' ki k'u'xlan

Not they forgot them.
A long time they were dead their fathers.

Mawi xkisacho.
Xojeroq kekamoq ki qajaw.

They gave their wives nations.
They became fathers-in-law.

Xya' kixoqil amaq'.
Xkiji'aj.

Then they married women three.
They said therefore when they went:
“We go there its coming out sun.
There they came our fathers,”
They said when they took their road
Three sons.

Ta xech'oko ixoq e oxib'.
Xecha' k'ut ta xeb'ek:

These went there across sea.

Then they went.

E oxib'

Only there is their wisdom,
There is also their knowledge.

Xawi k'o ki na'oj,

Not surely only then people their nature.
They instructed behind

Ma na xa e ta winaq ki k'oje'ik.

“Not we die,

“Mawi kojkamik,

They said
When they went they three.

Xecha'

Merely only they passed over on its top sea
When they arrived therefore there its coming out sun.

Xawi xere xe'ik'owik chuwi' palo

Then they went to receive their lordship.
This therefore his name lord this,

Ta xb'e ki k'ama' ri ajawarem.
Are' k'ut u b'i' ajaw wa',

Its lord
He of its coming out sun.

Rajawal

THEN they arrived therefore

Xe'opon wi.
TA xe'opon k'ut

Before his face lord.
Nacxit his name great lord.

Chuwach ajaw.
Nakxit u b'i' nima ajaw.

Only guardian word,
Crowded his dominion.

Xa ju q'atol tzij,

He therefore gave hither its sign lordship,
All its tokens.

Are' k'ut xya'w uloq retal ajawarem,

Then came its sign Ah Popol,
Ah Pop Reception House.

Ta xpetik retal Aj Popol,

Then came therefore its sign glory,
Their lordship as well:

Ta xpe k'ut retal u q'aq'al,

Completed his giving hither Nacxit

When they brought hither from the other side sea

Ronojel k'u kek'am ri xepetik,

Its writings Tulan,
Its writings they called to it.

U tz'ib'al Tulan,
U tz'ib'al xecha' chire.

Many had entered within,
Within their word.

K'i okinaq chupan,

THEN as well then whey arrived there,
On its top their citadel Hacavitz its name,

K'ATE puch ta xe'ulik chiri',
Chuwi' ki tinamit Jaq'awitz u b'i',

There therefore they gathered all Tamub,
Ilocab they gathered themselves.

Chiri' k'ut xekuch wi ronojel Tamub',

All nations they rejoiced
When arrived

Ronojel amaq' xeki'kotik

They rejoiced Rabinals

Great now their essence

Not first was completed

Then truly therefore their lordship.
Where

Ta qi k'ut kajawarem.

They are there
Hacavitz.

E k'o chiri'

Only there is with them all that came from coming out sun. Xa k'o kuk' ronojel ri xpe releb'al q'ij.
Long time then therefore they did it
Najt chi k'ut xkib'an
There
On its top mountain.

Chiri'
Chuwi' juyub'.

Many now
All of them.

E k'i chik

There therefore they died
Their wives

Chiri' k'ut xekam wi

Balam Quitze,

Then they came,
They abandoned behind

Ta xepetik,
Xkoqotaj chi kanoq

The their mountain.
One other mountain they looked for

Ri ki juyub'al.
Jun chi juyub' xkitzukuj

Where they settle.
Not counted mountains they settled.

Are ketik'e wi.
Mawi ajilam juyub' xetik'e wi.

Then they named,
Then they gave names as well to them

Ta xekob'i'k,
Ta xeb'i'naj puch chire

They gathered together,
They became strong

Xemolomanik,
Xech'ijomanik

---
First our fathers.

E nab'e qa chuch,
E nab'e qa qajaw.

They said ancient people
When they spoke,

Xecha' ojer taq winaq
Ta xkitzijoj,

Then they vacated as well
Behind

Ta xkitolob'a' pu

First their citadel,
Hacavitz its name

Nab'e ki tinamit,
Jaq'awitz u b'i'

Then they arrived again therefore there
They began again

Ta xe'ul chi k'u chiri'
Xkitikilib'ej chik

A citadel
Chi Quix its name.

Jun tinamit
Chi K'ix u b'i'.

Long time again they did there
On its top one division citadel.

Najt chi xkib'an chiri'
Chuwi' ju ch'ob' tinamit.

They begat daughters,
They begat sons as well

Kemi'alanik,
Kek'ajolanik puch

There theirs they were.
These four mountains these,

Chiri' ke e k'o taq wi.
Are' taq kaji juyub' wa',

Only one shall enter
Its name the their citadel.

Xa jun xchok wi
U b'i' ri ki tinamit.

They married their daughters,
Their sons only they would give as a gift.

Xkik'ulub'a' ki mi'al,
Ki k'ajol xaqi chikisipaj.

Only act of compassion,
Only also as presents they would do it.

Xa toq'ob'anik,
Xa pu mayjanik chikib'ano.

Their payment their daughters they would receive.
Only good their existence they did.

Rajil ki mi'al chikik'amo.
Xa utz ki k'oje'ik xkib'ano.

Then they passed through there on its top
Each division of citadel.

Ta xe'ik'o chiri' chuwi'

Chi Quix:

Wa' taq u b'i'
E Chi K'ix:

Their names mountains.
They tarried

U b'i' juyub'.

When therefore they investigated the mountain,
Their citadel as well.

Are k'ut kakinik'wachij ri juyub',
Ki tinamit puch.

Residence mountain they look for.
They therefore many now all of them.

Ulaj juyub' kakitzukuj.
E k'u k'i chik chi konojel.

Only therefore dead
The receivers lordship its coming out sun,

Xa k'u kaminaqoq
Ri k'amol ajawarem releb'al q'ij,

Grandfathers now they arrived there
On its top each citadel.

E mamaxel chik xe'ul chiri'
Chuwi' jujun tinamit.

Not surely they received their faces.
They passed through

Ma na xuk'am ki wach
Ri xe'ik'o wi

Numerous hither afflictions,
Misfortunes they did.

Je taq wi uloq k'axk'ol,
Ra'il xkib'ano.

Until its long time they discovered
Their citadel

K'a u najt xkiriq wi

Grandfathers,
As well fathers.

E mamaxel,
E pu qajawixel.

This therefore its name citadel
They arrived at:

Wa' k'u u b'i' tinamit
E xe'ul wi:

The text reads ca, which is likely a scribal error for cu.

---
Its name mountain their citadel they dwelt.

CHI ISMACHI' k'ut,
U b'i' juyub' ki tinamit xek'oje' wi.

Next also they settled,
There therefore they attempted glory.

Chi nay puch xe'amaq'elab' wi,
Chiri' k'ut xkitij wi q'aq'al.

Was ground their lime plaster,
Their whitewash,

Xk'aj ki chun,
Ki sajkab',

In fourth generation lords,
Said therefore the Co Nache,

Chukaj le oq ajawab',
Xecha' k'u ri K'o Nache',

Only Beleheb Queh,
With as well Magistrate Lord.

Xu B'elejeb' Kej
Ruk' puch Q'alel Ajaw.

Then lorded therefore Lord Co Tuha,
With Iztayul their names,

Ta xajawar k'ut Ajaw K'o Tuja,
Ruk' Istayul ki b'i',

Ah Pop,
Ah Pop Reception House.

Aj Pop,
Aj Pop K'am Ja.

They lorded there
Chi Izmachi.

Xe'ajawar chiri'
Chi Ismachi'.

Very good citadel it became,
They made it.

Utzilaj tinamit xuxik,
Xkib'ano.

Only therefore three the great houses came to be there
Chi Izmachi.

Xa k'u oxib' ri nim ja xux chiri'
Chi Ismachi'.

There were not the one score four great houses.
Still three their great houses.

Maja b'i'oq ri juwinaq kajib' chi nim ja.
K'a oxib' oq ki nim ja.

Only one its great house
Cavecs.
Only therefore one great house
Before Nihaibs.
Only as well one
Of Ahau Quichés.

Xa jun u nim ja
Kaweqib'.
Xa k'u jun nim ja
Chuwach Nijaib'ab'.
Xa nay pu jun
Rech Ajaw K'iche'.

Only two enchantment great houses
The two divisions of lineage

Xaqi kaib' chi kumatzil nim ja
Ri ka ch'ob' chi chinamit

---
Only one their hearts.

Are e k'o Chi Ismachi'.
Xa jun ki k'u'x.

There were not bad feelings,
There was not as well their anger.

Maja b'i kitzelal,
Ma pu ja b'i ki kayewal.

Only steadfast
Lordship.

Xa li'anik
Ajawarem.

There was not their contention,
Their disturbances as well.

Maja b'i ki ch'a'oj,
Ki yujuj puch.

Only purity,
Only sense of community there is in their hearts.

Xa saq,
Xa amaq' k'o chi ki k'u'x.

There was not left facing,
There was not as well fire facing

Maja b'i moxwachinik,
Ma pu ja b'i q'aq'wachinik

They did.
Still small their glory.

Xkib'ano.
K'a ch'uti'noq ki q'aq'al.

Not yet they have pulled it together,
Not as well they have become great.

Maja ki kanuk'maijoq,
Maja pu kanimaroq.

Then they tried it therefore,
They strengthened shield

Ta xkitij k'ut,
Xkikowisaj pokob'

There
Chi Izmachi.

Chiri'
Chi Ismachi'.

Certainly sign therefore their lordship this when they did it. Xretal k'ut kajawarem ri' ta xkib'ano.
Certainly sign their glory,
Xretal ki q'aq'al,
Sign as well their greatness.
Retal nay pu ki nimal.
Then it was seen therefore by Ilocab,
Then was created war by Ilocab.

Ta xil k'ut rumal Ilokab',
Ta xwinaqir lab'al rumal Ilokab'.

They desired he be murdered the lord Co Tuja.
Xraj ul kamisaxoq ri ajaw K'o Tuja.
Only therefore one lord they desired therefore themselves. Xa k'u jun ajaw xraj k'u kib'.
This the lord Iztayul they desired to convince,

Are' ri ajaw Istayul xraj ki tijoj,

---

Xraj tijox kumal Ilokab' chi kamisanik.

Not therefore went out
Their left facedness behind his back lord Co Tuja.

Ma k'u xel aponoq
Ki moxwachib'al chirij ajaw K'o Tuja.

Only behind their backs it fell.
Not first died then the lord by Ilocab.

Xa chikij xqaj wi.
Ma nab'e xkam ta ri ajaw rumal Ilokab'.

Thus its foundation disturbance,
Clamor war as well.

Keje' k'ut u xe'najik yujuj
Ch'akimal lab'al puch.

They invade first citadel,
They went as killers.

Xkokib'ej nab'e tinamit,
Xeb'ek e kamisanel.

This then therefore they desired,
The loss then their faces Quichés.

Are' ta k'u xkaj,
Ri sach ta u wach K'iche'.

Only then by themselves they exercised lordship in their
hearts,
Only therefore they arrived to receive.

Xa ta ki tukel xajawarik chi ki k'u'x,

They were captured,
They were despoiled therefore.

Xeteleche'xik,
Xekanab'ix puch.

Not many again
Were liberated of them.

Mawi jarub' chik
Xkolotaj chike.

Then began therefore sacrificing,
They sacrificed the Ilocab before his face god.

Ta xtiker k'ut pusunik,
Xepus ri Ilokab' chuwach k'ab'awil.

This now payment their offense came to be
By lord Co Tuja.

Are' chik tojb'al ki mak xuxik
Rumal ajaw K'o Tuja.

Many therefore entered into captivity,
They were enslaved,
They were made to be servants as well.

K'i chi k'ut xok chi munil,
Xe'alab'ilaxik,
Xewinaqix puch.

Only they went to give themselves
To being defeated
Because of their clamor war

Xa xb'e kiya' kib'
Chi ch'akix
Rumal ki nuk'b'al lab'al

Behind lord,

Chirij ajaw,

Xa k'u are' xe'ul k'amoq.

---

Chirij siwan tinamit.

Ruined,
Mocked then its face their lordship Quichés,

Xmaixik,
Xk'utux ta u wach rajawal K'iche'

Desired their hearts.
Not therefore it was done.

Xraj ki k'u'x.
Ma k'u xb'anatajik.

Thus its creation
Their sacrifice people before his face god.

Keje' k'ut u winaqirik
U pusik winaq chuwa k'ab'awil.

Then they made the shield
War its root

Ta xb'an ri pokob'
Lab'al u xe'

Then they began its shielding citadel Chi Izmachi,
There began its foundation glory.

Ta xtikarik u pokob'axik tinamit Chi Ismachi',
Chila' xtikar wi u xe'najik q'aq'al.

Because of this certainly great his lordship Quiché lord,
Everywhere enchanted lords.

Rumal ri' xa xnim wi rajawarem K'iche' ajaw,
Jumaj e nawal ajawab'.

There was not their humiliation,
There ws not mockery would enter to them.

Xma k'o wi ki yoq'otaj wi,
Xma k'o wi alachinaq chok chike.

Only makers to greatness
Lordship.

Xawi b'anol rech nimal

There they put down roots Chi Izmachi,
There became great their bloodletting god.

Chiri' xe'najinaq wi Chi Ismachi',
Chiri' xnimar wi u k'ixik k'ab'awil

They would be afraid now,
They feared as well all nations,

Chixib'in chik,
Xuxib'ij pu rib' ronojel amaq',

Small nations,
Great nations.

Ch'uti amaq',
Nima amaq'.

They witnessed their entrance
Captive people.

Xkiwachij rokik
Teleche' winaq.

They sacrificed,
They killed,

Xkipusu,
Xkikamisaj,

By their glory,

Rumal ki q'aq'al,

Ki tepewal,

The lord Co Tuha,
Lord Iztayul,

Ri ajaw K'o Tuja,
Ajaw Istayul,

Only three divisions of lineages were
There Chi Izmachi its name citadel

Xa ox ch'ob' chi chinamit xk'oje'
Chiri' Chi Ismachi' u b'i' tinamit

Still there again as well they began to feast,
To drink to their daughters.
Then they celebrated hither.

K'a chiri' chi nay puch xkitikib'a' wi wa'im,
Uk'aja chirech ki mi'al.
Ta xkisi'j uloq.

This their gathering together
The Three Great Houses,
Their names by them.

Are' ki kuchb'al kib'
Ri Oxib' Chi Nim Ja,
U b'i' kumal.

There therefore they would drink their drinks,
There as well they would eat their food,

Chiri' k'ut chikuk'aj wi kuk'ia',
Chiri' puch chikiwej wi ki wa,

Their price their sisters,
Their price as well daughters.

Rajil kanab',
Rajil pu mi'al.

Only joy in their hearts
Then they did.

Xa ki'kotem chi ki k'u'x

They feasted,
They ate within their great houses.

Xewa'ik,
Xe'echa' chupan ki nim ja.

“Only our giving of thanks,
Our gratitude,

“Xa qa k'amowab'al,
Xa pu qa paq'ub'al,

To our sign our agreement,
Its sign our word,

Chirech qetal qa tzijel,

Upon woman child,
Man child,” they said.

Chuwi' ixoq al,

There they gave names hither,
There as well they named

Chila' xkob' wi uloq,
Chila' puch xkib'ij wi

---
Seven nations selves,
Their cities selves.

Ki chinamit kib',
Wuq amaq' kib',

“We have intermarried,
We Cavecs,
We Nihaibs
We as well Ahau Quichés,” they said.

“Qa k'ulel qib',
Oj Qawikib',
Oj Nijaib'
Oj pu Ajaw K'iche',” xecha'.

Three lineages,
Three as well great houses.

E oxib' chinamit,
Oxib' puch nim ja.

Long time therefore they did there
Chi Izmachi.

Najt k'ut xkib'an chiri'
Chi Ismachi'.

Then they discovered again,
Then they saw as well,

Ta xkiriq chik,
Ta xkil puch,

One other citadel.
They abandoned on its top the Chi Izmachi.

Jun chik tinamit.
Xkoqotaj chiwi' ri Chi Ismachi'.

THEN as well then they rose up again hither,
They arrived there in citadel.

K'ATE puch ta xeyakataj chi uloq,
Xe'ul chiri' pa tinamit.

Cumarcaah its name
By Quichés it would be called.

Q'umarkaj u b'i'

Then they arrived now lords,

With Cucumatz,
With as well all lords.

Ta xe'ul chik ajawab',

Its root nation,
Its root life,
Creation.

There as well they made their houses gods.

Chiri' k'ut k'i xkib'an wi kochoch.
Chiri' nay puch xkib'an wi rochoch k'ab'awil.

At its center
Its top citadel they gave it.

Chu nik'ajal

Then they arrived,
Then they planted as well.

Ta xe'ulik,

Then as well its greatness now
Their lordship.

K'ate puch u nimarik chik

Many now,
As well crowded now.

E k'i chik,
E pu tzatz chik.

Then they planned now
Their great houses.

Ta xkina'ojij chik

They were gathered,
They were divided as well,

Xemoloxik,
Xejachajox puch,

Because generated their contention.
They envied one another

Rumal xwinaqir ki ch'a'oj.

Upon their price their sisters,
Their price their daughters.

Chuwi' rajil kanab',

Because only not now sustenance,
Their drink before their faces.

Rumal xa mawi chi tzaqon,

This now therefore its root now
Their division selves.

Are' chi k'ut u xe' chik

Then they turned on each other,
Turning over

Ta xkitzolb'ej kib',

They infuriated each other.
Then they split apart

THUS were completed one score four lords,
One score four as well of great houses came to be.

KEJE' k'ut xtz'akat wi juwinaq kajib' chi ajawab',

Not as well they did it,
Not they worked.
Not as well they made then their homes,
Not as well only then they made their homes their gods.

Only because they had become many their vassals,

Not surely only their luring,
Only then as well their abduction,

Even when war therefore

Still because of their spirit essence lords
They were glorified,

They became glorious,
They became sovereigns as well.

Then they begat sons again therefore,
Even their sons therefore.

They were split apart all nations.

Still kept up

Not bring their tribute
To all of them.
Fell their citadels,
They carried their tribute

Before their faces Quicab,

They were bled,
They were shot at wooden post.

Not there was their day,
Not there was their descendents came to be.

Straightaway it would be split open

Like this it would break open thunder,
To shatter stones.

Suddenly now they would humbly offer nations

True that warrior.
He received therefore their tribute all nations.

Xuk'am k'ut u patan ronojel amaq'.

Then they planned therefore lords all of them,
Then went blockaders

Ta xena'ojin k'ut ajawab' konojel,

Around canyons,
Around citadels.

Rij siwan,

THUS then their coming out sentinels,
Lookouts warriors.

“If will come again,
Then will arrive its guard

“We chipe chik,
Ta chul u laq'ab'ej

U tinamit,

Then they gathered their thoughts all lords,
Then went out their orders:

Ta xkikuch ki na'oj konojel ajawab',

“Like the our stockade,

Like as well our fortress,

“Keje' ri' qa k'ejoj,

Our palisade they shall become,
This now our anger,
Our war prowess then they shall become,”

Qa k'oxtun chuxik,

They said all lords.
Then they went out their orders

Xecha' konojel ajawab'.
Ta xe'elik u wab'an

The text uses the contracted form xkiba.

---
Opposers of warriors.

Jujun chi chinamit,

Then they were instructed therefore,
Then they went as well orders,

Ta xepixab'ax k'ut,

Guardians their mountain nations.
“Go, because our mountains now.

Laq'ab'ey u juyub'al amaq'.
“Chib'ek, rumal qa juyub'al chik.

Do not fear if there are still warriors
That come again with you as killers to you.

At once come to tell it.

Then were split apart their grandfathers,

The manuscript reads cabi in the K'iche' version, but is transcribed chabi in Ximénez’s parallel Spanish translation, indicating a
scribal error. Chabi (Arrow) is the more likely spelling in this context.
