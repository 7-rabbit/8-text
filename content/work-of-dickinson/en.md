<h1>The Work of Dickinson</h1>

When Phoebus with his rayes bright<br/>
Through the Raine takes his flight<br/>
His heate is then soe nourishinge<br/>
To the Earth and every other thinge<br/>
That sapp and roote doth then revive<br/>
By Phoebus heate attractive<br/>
Drawing by branches of the vine<br/>
Water mingled with Earth fine<br/>
Containeinge also fier and Ayre<br/>
Which liquor on Earth hath noe peere<br/>
CHAOS veterum some doe it call<br/>
Confused in it the Elements all<br/>
Wherefore draw thou a water bright<br/>
Contayneng in it the fiers might<br/>
And in the residence thou shalt finde<br/>
An Earth black as man of Inde<br/>
Which into Luna looke thou throwe<br/>
Till it be whiter then the snowe<br/>
That Earth put in a glasse faire<br/>
And put thereto of his water cleere<br/>
But close the mouth well of the Glasse<br/>
That the Spirit doe not out passe<br/>
A dayes space then lett them stand<br/>
To be buried in could sand<br/>
Then doe it in a bath of lent heate<br/>
That faint water it maye out sweate<br/>
So weake water thou shalt up still<br/>
But fier beneath with Earth will dwell<br/>
When all the fainte water is drew<br/>
And fier left in the Earth belowe<br/>
Then of this water put on more<br/>
And do as earst thou didst before<br/>
But often times thou must doe this<br/>
To gett much store of fier I wisse<br/>
So when thy fier is multiplied<br/>
Which still belowe in Earth will bide<br/>
Then hast thou gott a burning fire<br/>
That draw forth at thy owne desier<br/>
For Earth with his attractive might<br/>
Keepes downe with him the fire bright<br/>
First hide the fire the Earth within<br/>
And afterward looke thou them twinne<br/>
Thus Raymund ment when he did say<br/>
Absconde ignem in intimis terrae<br/>
Then set thy glass in dry fire<br/>
Till the white fumes doe appeare<br/>
Receive the same cloudes bright<br/>
Which tourne the water greate of might<br/>
This water if thou doest not knowe<br/>
Some thinge thereof I will the shewe<br/>
Of which Philosophers meane<br/>
From bowels of the Earth updrawe<br/>
By Phoebus might as earst was shewne<br/>
Mercury vegetable it is without doubt<br/>
That causeth Cropp and roote to sproute<br/>
Ignis humidus forsooth it is<br/>
The comfort of our life I wis<br/>
Mercury vegetable that men of clatter<br/>
That reduceth Gold to his first matter<br/>
This is the key that all must done<br/>
To open the bodies of Sonne and Moone<br/>
Also the menstrue vegetative<br/>
The metalline body that doth revive<br/>
The menstrue resolutive is the thinge<br/>
Which the menstruum resolved forth doth bringe<br/>
Then rectifie this water of might<br/>
And doe in it obryson bright<br/>
Which thou that tourne to his first matter<br/>
As doth Ice in warme water<br/>
And so together thou must convert<br/>
That never asunder they shall depart<br/>
Then circulate them so thou shall<br/>
To heale in man diseases all<br/>
For then thou has Electrum right<br/>
The first essence of the Sonne bright<br/>
This is the Philosophers Sulphur vive<br/>
Theire Tinctur, lead, theire Gold of life<br/>
Likewise Luna thou maist reduce<br/>
To serve the to an other use<br/>
If thou hast grace then mayst thou finde<br/>
A water of an other kinde<br/>
Which faster to the metall doth cleave<br/>
Ingendred in the Earth beneath<br/>
Reduce him rightly into water<br/>
Which of metalls is first matter<br/>
Whose partes so divide thou shall<br/>
Into Earth and water minerall<br/>
That after they may conjoyned be<br/>
To cure in metalls leprosy<br/>
And for the order of true workenge<br/>
In figures is satt downe every thinge<br/>
To make white stone and the redd<br/>
Elixir vitae to putt away dread<br/>
To shew the order I meane truly<br/>
For workes in Bookes disordred bee<br/>
And keepe this secret I the praye<br/>
As thou wilt answear it at doomes day<br/>
And keepe it out of wicked hands<br/>
Which in no feare of God stands<br/>
And keepe it well in safety<br/>
To guide thy bretheren eke and thee<br/>
The key of all is heere in briefe<br/>
Which erst by none was ere so reife<br/>
And looke that aye thou live aright<br/>
And serve the Lord in Truth and Spight<br/>
And dooe good deedes unto the poore<br/>
So shalt thou live for ever more.
